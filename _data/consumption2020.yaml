  explanation: >
    I went into this completely blind after it was recommended to me.
    This is feminist literature and is effectively an essay that starts out on the premise of why every woman should have a room of their own.
    It then dives into the opportunities that have been afforded woman and all the potential that has been lost in the process.
    Its approach is thoughtful and its use of a narrative manages to make the different ideas it brings up flow together without problem.
    While books of this nature can get preachy, I don't think this ever did since all it ever does is explore ideas to their logical conclusion which is how I prefer such works in general.

  explanation: >
    This is a book with an interesting premise where death has become obsolete and population control has become very strict.
    For every person born, someone already living must die.
    While the premise is interesting, the exploration of it is lacking.
    It is a very short book and I guess it tries to answer a question very quickly without discussing how it got there.

  explanation: >
    This is an epic book that takes place over many years like War and Peace or One Hundred Years of Solitude.
    While I don't consider this to be at the same level as those novels or even the best of Steinbeck's works, it is well thought out and a great epic.
    My biggest qualms come from the actions of the characters which seem forced because they are intended to follow in the footsteps of their parents in a Biblical sense.
    Often, this is natural, but sometimes, the progression of the plot does not seem quite as graceful.
    This is a minor complaint as the book is very well written and easy to follow.
    It is accessible and also has an overarching theme which makes it better than a large majority of novels out there.
    But is it the best classic I have ever read or the best epic? No.
    Was it one of the more enjoyable? Yes. It was a very pleasant read and I did not need to fight with the words which I think is something to be praised.

  explanation: >
    The hype is well justified and this is one of the best animated series ever made.
    We're only on season 1 as well, so I'm curious how they build on this in future seasons.
    This feels like the works of Tsukamoto Shinya mixed with Tarantino.
    I don't think I have found a work this interesting and energetic since I last watched a Takashi Miike film or this coherently stylish since Bleach. 
    The animation is very creative and mixes 2d and 3d in ways that I don't think I have seen before.
    Characters are unique and honestly, that is something that is getting more and more rare nowadays where many works reuse past tropes.
    Music is not exactly attention grabbing, but it great when it needs to be does its job.
    I am looking forward to season 2.

  explanation: >
    I thought that this was a movie about zombies, but it is much more than that.
    This is about filming a movie about zombies in one shot.
    The first part is the movie.
    The second part is the proposition for preproduction.
    The third part is the actual production.
    In that sense, this is a very meta film, because not only is this about a zombie film that was filmed in one take, it is also about filming the filming of a zombie film that was filmed in one take.
    Because of this, it has an added layer of analysis that other one take films don't have and makes it very interesting compared to other indie films.

  explanation: >
    I now understand the hype, and I have to say that this was a mindblowing conclusion to part 6.
    There was a speeding up of time, control of weather, suspenseful and very unconventional battles, and callbacks to other seasons.
    I think Jolyne Kujo is just as iconic as Kujo Jotaro, and the characters here were quite memorable.
    Like all other entries in the series, this operates on its own logic and yet it manages to work very well.
    I don't think I have enjoyed a Jojo show quite as much as this one since the second or third parts.
    Overall, probably my second favorite or most favorite entry in the series so far.

  explanation: >
    This was on my to watch for a few years, so I was glad I managed to get to it eventually.
    Although this did not need to be an animated film, it was and it uses its animation in subtle ways to enhance what is effectively a drama.
    I think while the story is compelling and emotional, if it slowed down and was just a few minutes longer, it would have been better.
    The themes of social isolation, identity, and (sudden) death are universal as always and well handled here.
    Overall, while imperfect, quite good.

  explanation: >
    This is like Heat if Al Pacino and Robert Deniro teamed up.
    It's a lot of fun, and fairly suspenseful.
    I was skeptical about Ma Dong Soek's role as a gang leader, but he plays it so well.
    The plot structure is great, and it manages to weave a good web.
    What I think might have been lacking was the motives of the serial killer, but other than that, this is a solid crime drama and thriller.

  explanation: >
    This is a shorter film that is trying to do something deep in a very indirect way.
    The closest thing I can think of is The Lighthouse, but this is less Lovecraftian and is more psychological which I personally prefer.
    There are themes of duality, a meta aspect regarding the filmmaking process, and enough ambiguity for some level of interpretation.
    Ingmar Bergman plays with light in very interesting ways.
    In addition to this, fact that the main characters are female is also a very unique aspect of this film.
    Overall, I think this played with concepts that I found more interesting than The Seventh Seal and it is of extremely high qualilty.

    A very short visual novel with a branching structure that is effectively a simulation of the future in the way Ace Combat 3 was a computer simulation.

    The downhill trajectory that started with the previous season continues here and the quality just seems to get worse in terms of storytelling.

  image: https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1523/92371.jpg
  explanation: >
    This starts off blasting right out of the gate and the pacing is ridiculously fast even by today's standards.
    The Mobile Suit Gundam series has come a long way, and this seems to throw everything at the viewer.
    Animation is great, and there is even some convincing cgi which is very surprising for 1988.
    Battles are large scale and nuclear weapons are used left and right like crazy.
    The score is great, and from a craftsmanship perspective, the only thing lacking are longer and more focused shots and scenes.
    The weak points are character motivations and the plot, but things move so fast that I think the flaws don't stand out quite that much.
    There is also not much of reference given to the Gundam Zeta or ZZ and characters from those series don't make an appearance which is disappointing.
    Overall, this is dense in detail and it is the best entry in the UC timeline that I have seen so far.
    With this, although there are more items in the UC timeline, this marks the completion of the main works within the timeline.

  explanation: >
    When I heard that there was a Lookism adaptation, I was curious how Korean animation would compare to Japan or China since Korea has many studios that do gruntwork for these other countries as well as some American animations as well.
    I think what surprised me first and foremost was the character design which felt more reminiscent of American animations like Avatar.
    While I think it is better than Japanese adaptations of webtoons as this is actually done in a Korean style, the story and execution has the feel of something that might have been popular in Japan 10 years ago.
    In other words, it feels dated, and execution is not necessarily the best.
    That said, this is in guilty pleasure territory for me, so if there is another season, I probably won't complain.

  explanation: >
    This has a Death Billiards type of feel, but it has some missteps in its execution.
    While the story is about death and it uses a novel mechanic of 3d scenes in a visual novel, this is not enough to make up for the weak story.
    Dialogue seems shallow at times and cutting out the fat could make it much better.
    Character designs are bland, and portions of the game where you get side items like memories are underdeveloped in terms of being engaging.
    The setting is fairly static with everything taking place at a cafe which makes it come across as more boring than it actually is.
    Music by Kevin Penkin is good, but not his best.
    Overall, I consider this mediocre. While it hits some notes, it can definitely be better.

  explanation: >
    This is a story of a man who is slowly dying while everyone around him abandons him and denies his illness.
    Ivan Ilych is not special, and as the main focus of our attention as the reader, he acts as us which means that the messages here regarding death are universal.
    This shows that Tolstoy can tell a great story not only in the traditionally long Russian format as seen in War and Peace, but also in the short novella format.

    A thorough book that covers the life of Leonardo da Vinci while also analyzing what makes him tick.
    The way in which Leonardo da Vinci is always asking questions about everything and his status as a polymath comes across quite clearly.

  explanation: >
    A collection of musings on life, pessimism, absurdism, and death.
    It is quite thorough, and the prose is very well done.
    With that said, topics can be disconnected in a sense, and each essay? or short piece? can be read alone.
    I think with many works of philosophy, structure matters less than ideas.
    However, when compared to something like Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Kant's The Critique of Pure Reason, or Plato's Republic, the larger picture is not the clearest which is a bit disappointing.
    Overall, I really liked it, but I question where it should be as highly regarded as it is given some of the shortcomings I have mentioned.

    This was completed on the Khan Academy site.
    This covers everything from charge to signals to fourier coefficients to reverse engineering of household devices.
    The field seems to be multidisciplinary with a heavy usage of physics, mathematics, logic and some work with circuits and hardware.
    I would say that out of many of the other areas that I studied, this seems to have the most overlap with other fields.

    30 years later, the story of an event that led to South Korea ending the fifth republic and moving towards a real democracy is told in a dramatized form.
    This film focuses on the death of a student at the hands of the military regime due to torture.
    We are shown how free speech is suppressed and pretty much anything goes in order to catch North Korean spies.
    Although this is more than 2 hours in length, it does not ever get boring and it feels incredibly dense in details.
    Another thing that was well handled was how different Korean culture was in the 80's. It is quite different from South Korea today.
    Acting was well handled and while everything else in terms of craftsmanship did not stand out, the fact that it was unnoticed is by itself an accomplishment.
    Overall, this is a political film of great scale that tells of a turbulent time in modern South Korean history.

  explanation: >
    This is a book that is among decent company.
    Not only does this get across the feeling of disillusionment and misanthropy, but it also gets across the feeling of being disaffected as a generation.
    There are references to the bourgeoius and rejections of the new.
    These themes are still relevant today and the surreal way in which the story is told manages to to get across its ideas.
    Overall, I think Steppenwolf adds to its genre in the same way Albert Camus' The Stranger did as well.

    This is a period epic by Stanley Kubrick. This means that it is automatically a great film.

  explanation: >
    An absolute thrill from beginning to end. Almost everything is good. The dogfights and filming is good.
    The music is good. The acting is good. Pretty much everything that I care about in a movie is handled well here and the visual quality is consistent with what I would expect of a film directed by Joseph Kosinski.
    There are times when I felt like it hit notes that Ace Combat did.
    The planes were real planes (except for the enemy ones), and the camera work inside and outside the cockpit is terrific.
    However, unlike Ace Combat which can have anti-war messaging, this is undoubtedly a piece of propaganda.
    This means that the geopolitical notes fall flat (the enemy belongs to an unnamed country), but themes of moving past tragedy and teamwork are very well handled.
    Overall, I enjoyed it very much and it is a very good film.

    This is a lot of fun and it takes its time to make something that is beyond the traditional creature flick.

    This is essentially a simplified version of Atomic Habits with smaller scope.

    This is a film that is fairly consistent in quality when compared to the previous entry.
    It is just as suspenseful, and Millicent Simmonds acting really carried the film when she was on screen.
    This film also expands on the background behind the aliens and provides a certain level of exposition in a visual format.
    The act of adding exposition as well as expanding the scope of the film could backfire, but it did not take away from the quality of the film and Krasinski's directing remains focused.
    While I don't think it is better than the first film, I think it is fairly close in terms of quality.

    A video game that uses M.C. Escher type visuals as a mechanic in its puzzles.
    The music is calming, and the visuals are simple.
    It manages to use a simple mechanic to great effect.
    When compared to something like Manifold Garden, it is more simplistic, but what it is trying to do is fundamentally different.

  explanation: >
    I liked this one more than Zeta despite it being less critically acclaimed.
    For one, the mixture of humor at the beginning with the heavier themes at the end seem to compliment one another and act as better character development.
    Because of this, the characters were more likeable.
    With that said, this suffers from the same strange plot developments as Zeta while missing cameos from Amuro and Char.
    As we progress through the UC timeline of Gundam, I am noticing that the novelty factor which made the first Mobile Suit Gundam so interesting is lacking in the later installments.
    This is what makes the later series like Zeta and ZZ underwhelming for me.
    With that said, I am looking forward to Char's Counterattack which is said to be the crown jewel of the timeline.
    It is nowhere close to perfect and is arguably not even that good, but I found ZZ easier to bear than Zeta.

    The short story is that we do not live within a meritocracy and that hard work alone is not enough although it is required.
    There is also a matter of the opportunities available at a particular time as well as the luxury of spending the time needed to master something.
    Because these are things I already knew, I did not find this to be all that novel.
    With that said, this book was published in 2008, so maybe it was more novel at the time.

  explanation: > 
    Neuralink went from pigs to monkeys. Apparently, they will soon move onto humans.
    With that said, the technology still seems rudimentary and compared to two years ago when they were working with pigs, it seems like the pacing is not quite what one would expect when looking at the agility of companies like SpaceX and OpenAI.
    Telapathic typing is cool, but what if you do not need to move a cursor around and could just think the words or the letters?
    This is what I think is missing and as long as the software side is stuck in a world that can be viewed with a screen, it will be limited compared to what is truly possible with a neural interface.
    With that said, the translating of messages from the brain and spinal cord is promising. I wish they can improve the software portion of it, because that feels underdeveloped.

  explanation: >
    This reads well, but in terms of content, I was not the biggest fan.
    The prose and the pacing worked, but I did not care for the characters.
    The main character gets cucked which was a strange decision, there is a magic system that is decently developed but not fully explored, and the world is not that fleshed out.
    There are wars and political maneuvering, but it seems like there are no greater themes, morals, or purpose behind the writing.
    At the end of the day, I guess it's a tale of revenge and triumph with an identifiable arc for its characters, but I don't see the point or a clear idea of what it is setting out to do and as a result, it was not all that memorable.
    I think if I was younger, I might have enjoyed this, but anyone who is reading for content and substance may be disappointed.

  explanation: >
    I only watched the first season because I heard it only goes downhill from there.
    With that said, I was not a fan of the first season.
    The primary reasons being cinematography and editing.
    It feels like a tv show and not a carefully planned work which is what makes it feel less worthwhile despite it being a work in a genre that I like.
    Camera angles make no sense, cameras shake for no reason, and pacing is either slow or inconsistent.
    The future shown in Altered Carbon seems drab and dull due to questionable color grading as well.
    It really should not be like this, because I feel like the underlying story has promise. Concepts like switching bodies like they are interchangeable parts is interesting.
    However, the execution is sub-par.

    A horror game based on the White Terror period of 1960's Taiwan.
    This has had a movie and a tv show based off of it, so it has had an impact within Taiwanese culture.
    Like most East Asian countries of the time, the 20th century was a time of turmoil and that turmoil came across quite well in this game.
    On its own merits, it is quite minimal in terms of sophistication, but it is able to sell the feeling of dread expected of this type of work while offering an emotional conclusion and historical context to the events of the story.
    When compared to a truly great game like Signalis which I played recently, it may be a bit underwhelming, but this is a good game for an indie studio that does what it set out to do.

    Suspenseful from beginning to end and has the novel approach of telling a story entirely through cameras and computer screens.
    Unlike other films which use the internet as a gimmick, this seems to have a more realistic approach to how people use computers and social media.
    Because of this, it comes across as more convincing.
    John Cho seems to singlehandedly carry this film and does very well.
    Overall, it is very entertaining and does not let up once it gets moving.

    This is a good combination of CD Projekt Red's storytelling with studio high paced Trigger's animation style.
    The fast pacing and unconventional animation makes for an exciting and fast moving story.
    The soundtrack which appears to draw from Cyberpunk 2077's soundtrack works very well.
    It does not feel Japanese which in turn makes it feel fresh.
    With that said, I think its first half was significantly better than the second half and while it was good, it could have been better if it slowed down a bit.
    I felt this to be the case particularly with some of the more emotional scenes and the ending in particular.
    As a result, while I enjoyed it quite a lot and think it is Imaishi Hiroyuki's best work since Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, it flaws were obvious and unapologetic.

    Criminally underrated.
    This is a love letter to ps1 era games and feels like a cross between Silent Hill, MGS, Dead Space, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.
    The gameplay is suspenseful and the story, while difficult to understand, is emotional and even romantic.
    The cyclical nature of its story and the multiple endings is something I also very much appreciated.
    There are references to H.P. Lovecraft and The King in Yellow.
    The mixture of different languages such as Chinese and German made it feel very similar to Evangelion at times.
    Music is simple but does its job effectively. In terms of ambience it is similar to Iron Lung due to the Lovecraftian aspects.
    Honestly, this is one of the best horror games I have ever played and it is impressive to see what two developers are capable of.

    Action is fluid, and the story has decent emotional backing.
    I wish the world had more depth to it and that the film was longer, but that did not take away from my enjoyment.

    This is an OVA that takes place in the same world as Bleach.

    This is a well executed film that takes advantage of sound to build suspense.

    A very short game that is like a playable picture book of sorts.
    I think what it does that is novel is its use of color to create puzzles.
    With that said, gameplay is very minimalistic, and the story is also like a picture book where it is very simplistic.
    I think the tie-in to What Remains of Edith Finch was interesting.
    It may have been more meaningful to play this before What Remains of Edith Finch, but since this was a PS3 release, that was not possible for me.
    Beyond that, I think it does not make a substantial impression.

    Many of the Pixar films are well crafted and critically acclaimed, but there are only a few that seem to go beyond and ask deeper questions.
    Never have I had a Pixar film affect me as deeply as this since Up or Wall-E. Inside Out came close, but it wasn't quite there in terms of asking the bigger questions.
    Honestly, the combination of jazz, black culture, and the purpose of life is something that hits way harder than I expected.
    This is something that I think adults would appreciate more than children, and I think that may have been the intention of this film.
    The idea that the spark of life is different from a purpose is very profound.
    The music is great. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross use their style of music to create a great ambient backing while the crazy pentatonic jazz runs of Jon Batiste are face melting and emotional.
    If Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru had a kid friendly update and was animated, I wonder if it would be like this.
    And like always, the animation is at top level with some of the New York scenes coming across as almost photorealistic at times.

    Cat parkour works without requiring too much skill, and as a result, it is not frustrating at all.
    The score is subdued, but does its job.
    I think this is most interesting in its more open world segments with exploration, but there is a good balance of open ended as well as linear parts with puzzle elements.

    The ending and the way in which certain times were blocked of from the time traveling reaches of kettles was interesting as well.
    In many ways, the way people are trying to make sense of the timeline felt like characters from Phillip K. Dick's Ubik trying to make sense of their reality.

    This is a mini series that has a lot of momentum from the moment it starts.
    There are references to older chess masters and common openings.
    I wish it showed more chess moves and explained things like pinning and other strategies.
    With that said, this is a story about characters and not necessarily chess despite many of the boards looking really legit.
    Anya Taylor-Joy does very well in her role and is able to bring out the idiosyncrasies of Beth Harmon.
    Things like the cold war, childhood trauma and drugs are examined as challenges that go beyond simple chess playing and make for original traits in a chess player.
    The score by Carlos Rafael Rivera was also very good.

    Red Bull has sold out despite making its way back to the home of breaking and has made their stream unavailable to those in the U.S.
    This, and the technical problems in addition to terrible camerawork make this the worst final in terms of management.
    The breaking, on the other hand is very high level and we are seeing levels of physical prowess and stamina that would have been considered abnormal 10 years ago.
    In addition to this, all competitors had signatures and a certain level of originality which was missing in the previous year's competition.
    Judging was questionable and it did seem that Red Bull sponsored competitored were favored at times.
    Sound quality on streams seemed fairly low.
    With that said, It is nice to see how bgirls are improving in terms of dynamism and difficulty.
    I believe they are more precise than bboys in terms of execution and if it were not for fewer rounds and less explosiveness, they would be pretty much the same as the bboys in terms of skill level.
    Overall, some trends are favorable while many are not. I'm starting to believe musicality, personality, and originality are starting to get overshadowed by execution and difficulty which is very concerning.

    Simply great. I would not place it at the same level as Chrono Trigger, FFVI, but I consider it to be as good or better than FFVII, FFIX, and FFX.
    I think the main flaws are that battles are too slow, and not all characters are fully developed (there are too many characters who do not have a deep purpose).
    With that said, it ties in well with Chrono Trigger, and the music is among the best video game soundtracks that I have ever listened to. This is not an exaggeration, its score is superior to Chrono Trigger in my opinion.
    From a visual perspective, although the PS1 graphics are dated, the art direction and decision making regarding what to place in each environment makes each area look visually pleasing. Sometimes, this is to the extent that it seems superior to FFX at times.
    The concept of parallel realities is growing in popularity today, but this is among the first works to do it in the mainstream, and it handles it very well while utilizing it as a game mechanic.
    With regards to gameplay, I consider it to be challenging, but it you learn the mechanics such as the element field and to run away from enemies, then it should be manageable.
    I wish there was more to this series, because although its true ending wraps things up somewhat well, it feels as though something is missing.
    As to what that is, I don't know, but since Japan does not output works like this anymore and the generation that made games like this are retiring, I think we will never find out which is a shame.

    Despite the story telling being rather simplistic, this is an iconic genre bending work.
    The animation, despite its simplicity and minimal character design, is also not that bad.
    It's not fluid, but the elementary shapes used to construct characters and backgrounds seem to do their job.
    What I think really makes this interesting, however, is how, with its episodic format, it's able to tackle different types of genres effectively.
    The fifth season, while not being as high scale as I thought it would be for a conclusion, used advances in technology to create more fluid sequences reminiscent of cowboy films and jidaigeki.
    Overall, I think it's worth watching at least the essential episodes and the fifth season.

    This is one of the higher rated entries in the Gundam UC timeline, but I did not understand the hype.
    Perhaps it was due to me watching the film trilogy for Mobile Suit Gundam, but the episodic format of this particular show did not agree with me.
    For me, the characters were the weak point and the melodrama fell flat.
    Having your main character be autistic is fairly unique, but it can be frustrating to the viewers.
    In addition to this, the sci fi aspects seemed to have been partially replaced with new age mumbo jumbo and a lack of structure when compared to the previous entry.
    I believe this would have worked far better if there was more of continuity between episodes and romances stopped popping up out of nowhere and ending a few episodes later.
    It very much felt like a Saturday cartoons type of show rather than a deep drama despite its antiwar sentiments and its darker ending.
    With that said, it has far better animation than the series that preceded it which makes things more bearable and it was nice to see characters from the previous entry make appearances and cameos.
    Overall, it's not bad, but I did not consider it to be that enjoyable.

  explanation: >
    This reminds me of those action crime films from the 80's like Lethal Weapon and Die Hard.
    Ma Dong Soek in this film has the impression of those 80's stars and a tough personality that comes across as iconic.
    With that said, this feels modern as well. Camera work is focused and tight and the editing is stylized.
    The insight into the Chinese-Korean aspects of the Korean population is also interesting.
    I don't think it is anything that we would find to be new, but the film is so well executed that it is an easy watch with a sense of humor.
    I recommend this as a good time as it is a good crime film with smooth pacing and it is not a film where the viewer needs to get emotionally involved.

  explanation: >
    This is a show that had a premise which placed it in guilty pleasure territory for me.
    I have not engaged in works of fiction that take place in alternate history, but I always wondered what we could have accomplished if the space race continued.
    In this show, it tries to answer that question and takes the race all the way to Mars in the third season.
    It does well and although it portrays the bureaucratic pains and inefficiencies of NASA and its different hierachies and divisions inaccurately, its focus on the physical aspects of space travel were welcome.
    What I did not appreciate, however, was the melodrama. It felt like it had situations that were contrived simply for the purpose of suspense rather than drawing suspense from the premise alone which has an ample amount of it.
    There was also a clear agenda in some of the subplots which felt unnecessary while also being clumsily handled.
    Because of this, I consider this imperfect, but very enjoyable.
    Events such as an actual race to Mars, launch of sea dragons, and the Soviet Union's Buran were great.

  explanation: >
    Maybe it is because of the age of this work, but it feels fairly dated and goes on strange tangents.
    In many ways, it feels like old school Star Trek, but it is more of an adventure than a cerebral hard scifi work.
    Many of the tropes and concepts used here have been used in other series and works that came after the publishing of this book.
    For this reason, it does not seem all that novel.
    Beyond this, the characters don't seem all that interesting, and it is really the setting and history of the universe Niven created which can have potential.
    Concepts such as breeding races for slavery and other purposes are novel. However, they don't seem fully explored.
    For this reason, while this may have been interesting for the time and though this is only part of a larger series, I cannot recommend this.

  explanation: >
    I feel like I have either read many books or movies with elements similar to this film, but never a single work that had everything I saw in one package.
    This has acting on the level of There Will Be Blood, Moby Dick level dialogue, and the drudgery of daily work found in The Turin Horse.
    All of these (with maybe the exception of Moby Dick) are great building blocks and they lead to a solidly crafted film.
    This is psychological and Freudian and it is very different from a psychological film with a more modern take.
    I don't think I've seen anything like this, and it is a very unique work that draws from many different sources to create something that feels fresh.

    The story may be unremarkable but well executed, but the main draw in my opinion are the visuals.
    Rarely are there films that have such a fluid level of 2d animation. In addition to this, every scene is highly detailed.
    Compared to the show, I consider this to be better in terms of pacing and stakes which is a fairly strong statement to make.
    With that said, this still feels like part of a show at times with regards to how the story is structured into segments.
    While I would have preferred a better flow between sections, I think it is overall an experience that the audience takes in rather than one that viewers analyze.

  explanation: >
    This is a book with a focus on anti-war sentiment while also using such sentiment within a setting that allows for some hard sci-fi world building.
    Despite the large scale of interstellar war and the changes the human race underwent over the course of many centuries, war on the ground seems somewhat unimpressive and gory as always.
    Since this is told from the perspective of infantry, the war is not that interesting, but the journey to and from the war zone is.
    Here, we see the effects of time dilation and it is used to great effect to allow the protagonist to see the course of a war over the centuries.
    Homosexuality becomes the norm and eventually all of humanity becomes a hivemind composed of clones.
    Seeing the protagonist navigate this future and the alienation in such a strange place is what makes this an interesting read.
    I think this has similarities to Starship Troopers. I think it's above average and interesting, but it didn't blow my mind.

  explanation: >
    The best in the series despite some smaller misteps with characterization and a story with a level of scale that is usually never seen in science fiction.
    This takes theoretical physics and uses it as an instrument to extrapolate to future and past universes.
    We go from concepts established in the previous novels such as dark forest deterrence and push the envelope to life forms capable of living in other dimensions.
    There are concepts here that are simply ahead of their time such as stellar class particle accelerators that utilize the vacuum of space, weapons that can flatten space into the second dimension, and alterations of physical constants to achieve light speed travel.
    In addition to this, cultural changes over the development of the human race were also a good detail that colored the story quite well.
    While this novel seems to look at a universe that was originally going to be cyclical in a big crunch manner, the way in which Liu Cixin warps the dominant heat death end state of the universe as the result of wars using dimensional weapons is simply genius.
    This brings to question what in the universe was caused by natural forces and what past it may have had prior to the big bang which is a question that many theoretical phycists don't have the imagination to even consider.
    It also asks what our moral obligations towards the universe and its entropic tendencies are.
    Overall, this is probably among the greatest science fiction novels I have ever read, and the trilogy as a whole should be studied as required reading.

  explanation: >
    This is a novel that does two things: cover the influence of drugs, and talk about the American experience.
    Both of these are not exclusive and it does this in a way that is fairly unhinged.
    If there is a greater point to this novel, it tends to get lost in the strange events that occur throughout the book, but when compared to On the Road, this is not a bore.
    I don't know if I've ever read a book like this before, and the way it borders on the edge of coherence is somewhat unique.
    Whether it is good is another question, but I think it is an acquired taste.

  explanation: >
    I am of the belief that it is better to do one thing well rather than many things not that well.
    This is a game inspired by Shadow of the Colossus that tries to do similar boss battles in addition to survival mechanics, crafting, and Dark Souls style combat.
    All of this takes away from what should be the focus which is the atmosphere, story, and boss battles.
    In addition to this, the controls feel broken at times where physics sometimes goes out the window.
    This is less of an issue for the beginning bosses, but for the later bosses which require more sophisticated strategies to beat.
    I think the boss battles are well done if the frustrating aspects mentioned before are ignored.
    Now, when I think of Shadow of the Colossus, I think of a mysterious and fully fleshed world with inspiration from Ainu culture, incredible architectural design, a very unique soundtrack, and a protagonist whose motivations are somewhat known.
    All of this is mostly missing from Praey for the Gods. In addition to this, the lack of minimalilsm and presence of explicit exposition, I think the developers lost the plot.
    The inspiration from Fimbulvetr in Scandinavian mythology is interesting, but it feels surface level and the world feels very empty.
    For three developers, this is impressive and I think we should have more games like Shadow of the Colossus, but it should have spent more time being tuned and tested before being released.

    This time, south India has their own take on the time loop mechanic and it is very interesting.
    The main concept is interesting where the main character trying to stop religious riots from occuring.
    Unlike some other films, this actually has an explanation of why the time loop may be happening.
    In addition to this, there is an antagonist that is also capable of acting against the protagonist within the loop which is similar to Palm Springs in a way.
    S.J. Suryah as a corrupt police officer was great in his role.
    I think where this is weak is in execution. The idea is interesting, but camera work, stunt work, and other aspects are a bit sloppy.
    I do think it is enjoyable, but it is definitely flawed and it seems to play to some South Indian tropes to appeal to its targetted audience which may make it difficult to get into at times.

    I have had dreams similar to the main premise of this film, but this film manages to provide a logic to its premise which makes it very remarkable.
    The idea of a cold war allowing for scientific discoveries that can reverse the pull of gravity to create two worlds of humans operating within opposite gravities is very interesting.
    The use of Russian in some scenes and in some of the music helps to ground the story and flesh out the world.
    The way in which gravity is used to allow for characters to travel through the sky and underground is very fascinating and further play on perspective helps to enhance this.
    It can be mind bending at times, and there were moments that felt like something out of one of Nolan's sci fi films.
    From a story perspective, it may be a bit light on details, however, this is something that can be easily dismissed because of how enjoyable it is.
    This definitely shows and does not tell. However, it tells enough and everything is wrapped up quite well. Within around 95 minutes, it provides a full story with a resolution.
    Honestly, the film could have been longer and probably should have been, but this was really enjoyable and it does something that is very rare in the industry where an original IP was delivered from concept to execution.
    This work by Yoshiura Yasuhiro is consistent with the level of quality in animation that he has maintained since his work on Pale Cocoon and is recommended for those who are familiar with the genre.

  explanation: >
    This is a strange story that takes place on a planet with people who have a single gender.
    The text can be dense with a lot of terminology specific to the world that is being built.
    Despite this, once the reader gets past that, what they will find is an emotional story that explores social norms within the context of a galactic scale sci fi setting.
    It meanders from a main plot to the cultural underpinnings of the strange planet in which it takes place, but still manages to cover a lot within the short amount of time it takes to read it.
    At the same time, it manages to show deep friendship beyond sexual relations.
    Overall, what it is doing is may not be particularly novel today, but for 1969, I think it was probably ahead of its time.

    It took me a while to get through this one.
    Its themes are heavy, and human mortality is always at the forefront of its subject matter.
    The animation is decent and the soundtrack is great.
    There is a lot that can be covered when discussing immortality, but this does not dwell on the existential, but rather uses it to drive character development.
    This is a an advantage and a disadvantage.
    The advantage is that it does not get preachy. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to get attached to any mortal characters.
    With that said, it is quite a good ride despite its flaws and how it plays out in its continuation will determine the impression it ultimately makes.
    I think this is a strong start to something that could be profound and do recommend it.

    This was fairly impressive as it is able to make the most of a small budget to make a moderately higher scale film.
    At the same time, it tries to tackle Arthurian legend which is not an easy thing to do when adapting for a modern audience.
    All acting is good with Dev Patel as Gawain fulfilling his role effectively.
    There are some choices here that are probably divisive, but it is not as though they do not make sense.
    The names of the characters are withheld and the focus on Christianity is slightly diminished.
    The ending is similar to The Last Temptation of Christ, and just like that film, this one also has similar ambiguity.
    While it may not please everyone, everything done here is deliberate. Outside of the pacing and editing I consider it to be very well made.

    I loved the visual style of this film.
    It manages to be suspenseful and use imagery that is deeply profound.
    It has a feeling like Indiana Jones crossed with The Exorcist.
    One thing I wish there was less of, however, was the cgi.
    The theme of greed was an interesting one, but it seemed like the story may have lacked some depth.
    This, however was made up for by the atmosphere and the soundtrack by Jesper Kyd.
    Overall, while the story was not up to par, I do think this is a great film simply because what it is trying to do visually is so unique.

    It is a post apocalyptic novel with simplistic prose. It does not make any large mistakes and it is short enough to not overstay its welcome.
    The relationship between father and son is well established, and I can see familiar themes in other post apocalyptic works.
    There is a certain level of ambiguity that requires some work on the part of the reader as well regarding the cause of the apocalypse which was an interesting touch.
    I don't think it is particularly groundbreaking, but it is palatable and atmospheric.

    The pure bitterness as well as parallels to the struggles of the civil rights movement that followed in the years after the publication of this book make this a prescient work in addition to it being very human.
    The prose was very deliberate and it felt as though the words were hammering down on many themes with intensity.
    On an emotional level, it is able to portray anger and confusion in a way that many novels are unable to do so.
    It is direct when it needs to be, and it monologues when it needs to make a point. Overall, a viscerally charged novel.

    This is a film that should get more attention.
    Despite it taking its time, it never gets boring, and it seems to tackle a number of themes that I would expect to see more often in Chinese film, but don't.
    There are Buddhist themes, but also some common tropes seen in the wuxia genre.
    The choreography is interesting as it is more like old school Hong Kong without the wire work.
    Shots are great and resemble samurai movies and westerns.
    If this were on a larger scale, I may even consider this to be as great as Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

    My first Guy Ritchie film.
    I found it to be edited like a music video and the cinematography to be the same with some inspiration from new wave cinema.
    Films like these are definitely indicative of the 90's as directors like Darren Aronofsky also used similar camera work.
    The script is fast and tight. Honestly, this has all the makings of a great film, but it has a few issues.
    The first is that there is an unusually high level of silence in the film when such films usually fill empty spaces with music or dialogue or sound effects.
    The second is that the color grading does not make any sense. It is a sepia tone with some color.
    Because of things like this, it feels like it is the work of a director who has yet to achieve full maturity with respect to their style.
    Since this is a debut film, that is not surprising. However, this makes this a good film, but not a great one in my eyes.

    This is the usual schtick just executed very well.
    Stands have unique abilities and the situational nature of different battles keep things interesting.
    I in particular like the inspiration drawn from Memento and the battle that involved figuring out how to combat weaponized amnesia.
    With that said, I am glad that the series will be moving out of an American prison, as two seasons spent in the same setting can get tedious despite the good execution and consistent pacing.
    I hope it can move away from stands as well, because the concept is starting to get repetitive as well.

    This film is significantly better than the film that preceded it.
    Not only is there better camera work, tighter script, and better filmed choreography, but the Wong Fei Hung theme hits harder as well.
    I feel as though this film knows what it is and while it has some serious themes, it also does not take itself too seriously at all times.
    It is, at the end of the day, a fictionalized account of a folk hero that has taken many liberties to create a highly stylized film.
    Donnie Yen's ferocity has also made an impression, and I feel that this film was able to showcase his speed quite well.
    Overall, this is one of the great Hong Kong kungfu films and should be remembered as one of Jet Li's best.

    After reading this, I think I can say a fair amount of it probably flew over my head, because I did not understand whether it was a comedy, a satire, a work of fiction, or some strange combination of different genres.
    In addition to this, the use of the same names for many characters makes it very difficult to follow.
    I'm not sure what the point is. Is it about the cyclical nature of human behavior, or about the impermanence of all things?
    Maybe it is good. Maybe it is more of an organized meandering. Regardless, I will probably need to revisit this novel.

    This is a movie about Wong Fei Hung that took liberties with historical events to set up some entertaining kung fu fights.
    I think that is what the main draw of this is.
    The story is centered on imperialism, but the nationalistic story did not feel particularly interesting to me.
    Choreography is incredible and uses a variety of wire work and high level acrobatics that showcased a great amount of physical prowess.

  explanation: >
    This is the War and Peace of Japanese animation, and it is quite great.
    The story just builds and builds and it also offers great commentary on modern political systems while acting as a work of science fiction.
    In that sense, it is like Dune crossed with War and Peace or Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
    The advancing of the plot and different events feel almost like a documentary at times, and it is clear that research into history and politics was needed to make this work.
    The way in which democracies can fall is quite prescient and very relevant to todays' events.
    Animation is dated, and it may be the weak link. This is particularly true in the beginning. However, this is a space opera, so this may not be a big deal.
    Characters are thoroughly developed. There are no complaints there.
    The only other flaw may be the unsatisfying nature of some events and threads, but that could also be to the merit of the work as having being inspired by history.
    Overall, I am glad I spent the months it took to get through the 110 episodes and 2 films in this series. Works like this are a rarity.

    This covers the first few episodes of the series, and it is far better executed due to the higher budget, quality of animation, presenatiion, and pacing.
    While the series may seem more like a documentary due to the narration, this felt like it placed you in the moments.
    Battles and strategies make more sense and the idea of fighting in three dimensional space is well portrayed.
    Despite already seeing the first few episodes, the content is made quite compelling, and it is a great way to start the series.

  explanation: >
    For some reason, Faulkner's name rarely comes up when discussing classic literature, but after reading this, I believe Faulkner to be a giant.
    This is a book with heavy themes that approaches the presentation of such themes in an experimental manner that I found to be audacious and fresh.
    The four narrators and their biases color the story with personality while guiding the reader through the downfall of a family and the American south.
    This is brutal without necessarily being violent or melodramatic.
    I think this is a story with the ability to do quite a bit with a great deal of subtlety which is very rare even in great novels.

  explanation: >
    In my opinion, this is the best in the series and it is probably the film that I enjoyed the most.
    Unlike the other films which depends on the contrived stupidity of humans as a way to move plot forward, this does not resort to such cheap tricks.
    In addition to this, this builds on the foundation that was set by the other two films as well as the original film from 1968.
    Caesar and Andy Serkis who plays him is a fully fleshed out character that has developed well over the series.
    Cgi is great and almost photorealistic at times.
    There are parts of this that are reminiscient of The Great Escape which is great, but also funny, because it is an ape escape.
    Overall, a great film that also shows the previous films in a better light.

    Compared to the series, this has animation that is on another level which is to be expected.
    With regards to the story, this is a story of the beginning of the rivalry betwen Yang Wen-li and Reinhard von Müsel.
    It is entertaining and a slow burn like the series, but it is also more of an episode in the greater epic rather than a standalone work.
    If the series had an animation style similar to this throughout, I think I would have enjoyed the series more as well especially in the earlier episodes.

    For a gothic horror, this is surprisingly modern with its publication being at the end of the 1800's.
    While I think it could have been significantly shortened and tightened, it can be entertaining when it comes to the vampire hunting aspects of the story.
    With regards to its status as a classic, I'm a bit more skeptical.
    I don't know what the greater theme is behind this, and in that regard, it does not match up to Frankenstein or Jekyll and Hyde.
    While entertaining, its approach and presentation in the form of diaries is roundabout and lacks immediacy.
    Overall, I find it flawed.

    Sam Raimi is what makes this film unique, but the writing lacks coherence and purpose.
    The imagery and scenarios are quite interesting and the Bruce Campbell cameo was great as well.
    Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen perform well as different versions of their characters.
    With that said, there is no clear arc that acts as a pillar to tie everything together.
    All of the characters have their own development, but there is no central theme or character by which to give the film focus.
    As a result, it is not as good as it could have been which is quite a shame.
    Adding onto that, fatigue and saturation associated with the series is starting to set in, so expectations are higher than they usually would be.
    Despite this being about the multiverse, it does not take advantage of this in the same way Loki did.
    As a result, this feels more like an adventure with no conseequences.
    It is clear that it is there for the purpose of setup, but the after credit scene tells us next to nothing.

    While I consider this to be good, I also consider it to be a mixed bag at times.
    On one hand it is derivative.
    On the other hand, each season builds on itself and develops characters all while making references to the 80's.
    While I would like to see psychic battles on the scale of Akira, this is more of a better executed version of the Goonies.
    For me, the major appeal comes from the development which makes it feel similar to something along the lines of Harry Potter.
    The second and third seasons did not have much for me beyond character development, but I thought the first season which had the novelty of being first, and the fourth which played up all the past events for emotional scenes were the best.
    This is a show that has its moments. It is not perfect throughout, but those moments make watching it worth the time.
    In terms of craftsmanship, this feels more like tv than cinema, which is fine.
    Acting is good, and original music is great, but not better than some retrowave music I've heard in the past.
    Usage of music from the 80's is one of my favorite aspects, and it is done quite well.
    I am looking forward to the conclusion.

    This is Daniel Craig's last outing as Bond, and it while it was not bad, it did feel strange and a little bit underwhelming.
    Within this series, there were two films that I thought were great while the others were not and those were Casino Royale and Skyfall.
    With this film, camera work seems to be all over the place and it feels as though it is trying to be many different things and failing.
    In fact, what I thought this did well was all the things it did differently. I liked Ana de Armas' character who was a wildcard that only showed up in a few scenes.
    The ideas of using genetically programmable nanomachines to infect people was interesting, but I thought it felt like a cheap imitation of what the Metal Gear Solid series did a decade ago.

    It's Stanley Kubrick, so it is great.
    This was a film from a time when Kubrick made more conventional films.

    There are many films that attempted to depict the scale of the Roman Empire, but this is one that succeeds.

  explanation: >
    One of the best science fiction books I have ever read.
    Liu Cixin is the closest thing to a modern Isaac Asimov that I have read so far.
    In the previous novel, we are told of a war that is about to begin between Earth and a civilization light years away.
    Earth is given centuries to prepare and that alone may not be enough.
    While the events between the beginning and the end may not be the most plausible and may be culturally ignorant in some moments, the concept of a Dark Forest theory redefines how the Fermi Paradox is perceived.
    This, in addition to its rigorous basis of story in past events, science, and science fiction, makes the story very compelling despite its flaws.
    I absolutely enjoyed this, and I hope that the third novel in the Remembrance of Earth's Past series can improve upon the flaws while continuing with what makes the series so great.

    One of the most beautifully written books I have read recently that manages to cover a lot of ground through the use of Frankenstein's monster.
    While in popular media, the monster is a green thing with nails in its head, the monster described here is far more interesting than the caricature we may be more familiar with.
    The way in which both the creator and the creation show the ugliness of human behavior is very well handled.
    I was quite lucky in that I read Paradise Lost prior to reading this and the way in which literature was used to contextualize some of the happenings of the story was a good touch.

    The issue with this film is that it feels as though it was molded out of the same formula as other James Bond films while offering nothing unique.
    If it were not for Sam Mendes and Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography, this would be a bad film.
    What this ended up being, however, is a film that is mediocre.
    The biggest problem is the writing which does not allow for interesting plot developments.
    This, in effect, wastes the effort of the actors.
    Spectre and Blofeld should be a big deal for a James Bond movie, but this was underwhelming.

    I think this is my favorite A24 film so far.
    If Gen X had The Matrix, Millenials had Inception and The Lego Movie, then Gen Z has this and it is simply great.
    I had many flashbacks to The Matrix, but this is not about simulations but rather possibilities and alternate realities.
    In addition to that, it handles existential topics with a certain level of humor.
    I can't wrap my head around how this idea was developed due to the depth the themes have.
    I think the casting was interesting with this being Michelle Yeoh's best work.
    The special effects are convincing and stylized, and I am honestly surprised at the level of quality despite the scale and location not being quite at the level of an epic.
    Music is great too.
    I think despite the budget, it manages to have an unstoppable momentum and intensity that is very rare to see in films.

    While I am unsure of how many editorial changes were made by Otto H. Frank, this was interesting in that you could see a writer develop over time.

    It should be noted that this is a diary, so an overarching narrative is not something you will necessarily find here on the surface.
    Since this is relatively short, I think it is worth the read.

    A collection of stories that have a nested/recursive structure. I did not feel like going through 8000+ pages of these, so I just read through the first volume.
    The individual stories are a mix of interesting ones and mediocre ones, but they do offer a glimpse at the eastern world of the time.
    Many of the stories don't seem Arabian, and they probably were not.
    The influence of Islam is strong and there are religious overtones everywhere.
    In addition to this, many of the stories can be quite sexual as well which is something that is in stark contrast to the Islamic world of today.
    For me, the most interesting part of this was how people tell stories of people telling stories to the point that you don't know how many layers deep you are.
    Overall, very interesting. The stories themselves were sort of a take it and leave it type of situation, but the collective experience was good.

    This is series of three shorts by Don Hertzfeld that take place in multiple times with the same future.
    There are concepts such as the sharing of memories, using clones to achieve immortality and expand your lineage, and the degradation of human civilization.
    I liked the third short the most, but all of them have something to offer form hard sci-fi concepts to humor.
    While this was not quite what I was expecting with it being concerned with the future that takes place centuries from now, I think it was great and it brings up many existential questions that are fairly thought provoking.
    I particularly liked the concept of being able to move in between time which is something that I never even considered as a possibility.

    This is next level and made the previous two films worth it.
    It is hard to tell that this was based on a show that used an episodic format and the quality of animation is beyond that of a show.
    Scenes flow into each other and the scale is epic.
    Character development goes a step further and I would say that characters reach maturity.
    There is also a sense of resolution in how the leadership of Zeon is faced against instead of a series of battles strung together.
    The concept of newtypes has also been elaborated on and used as a mechanic to move the plot forward.
    There were times when I was reminded of Akira and Star Wars which makes this a great sci-fi epic and space opera film in my book.
    The scale of the battles and the use of weapons of mass destruction that utilize entire suns is quite eye opening.
    I am interested in continuing my foray into the UC timeline of the Gundam universe if time allows.

    This is a pretty fun inversion of the superhero trope.
    While this is about superheroes, it is more about other topics.
    There is political maneuvering, corporate espionage, and fun dialogue.
    The acting by everyone is pretty good and all the characters are well written.
    I think while it does cover some interesting topics, its main qualities are its bingeable nature and edgy approach.

    This is three things. First, it is Abrahamic religion with an Arabic spin. Second, it is the continuation of Christianity.
    Third, it is a work that significantly affected the Arabic language.
    Although I read an English translation, what is apparent is that this has a certain structure and deliberate approach in its subject matter.
    The suras, when compared with the disjointed nature of books in previous incarnations of the Abrahamic religion, seem to be ordered in a particular manner where each sura is shorter in length than the one that proceeded it.
    With that said, since this lacks narrative, it can be very dry.
    Also, there is significant overlap with the old testament since the new testament is considered by muslims to be corrupted.
    Overall, I think I learned quite a bit about Islam, but I wish there was more about the prophet Muhammad.
    When compared with the Bible which covered the life of Jesus in the gospels, this is lacking in that department despite Muhammad being a central figure.
    Although I understand why, from an outsider's perspective, it would have been appreciated.

    This is a poem that shows the battles fought between heaven and hell prior to the consumption of the fruit of the tree of life.
    I was expecting something with depth matching The Divine Comedy. This is not that, but it is true that Milton had a great respect for Christian mythology.
    The focus on Satan was interesting and its interpretation of Christianity was original, but I don't think I got much out of this one.
    Part of the reason for this is that there may have been some parts that were satirical, but they probably flew over my head.

    A psychological drama based on the same series of works by Thomas Harris as Silence of the Lambs.
    It is bloody and tasteful at the same time.
    Unlike the Hopkins films, this seems to have a better representation of the other characters.
    That is not to say that Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is inferior.
    His take on Hannibal as Satan incarnate was unique.
    Visuals were creative for a tv series.
    The dichotomy between the characters of Lecter and Hugh Dancy's role as Will Graham made for an interesting contrast.
    One thing I wish there was more of was the element of mystery. In this show, there is no guesswork since the characters figure things out through their empathetic capabilities.
    It would have been nice if there was some role for the viewer to play as well.

    This was an interesting and long read.
    Each book seems to have its own purpose, and while the Old Testament seems to have had some narrative coherence in the first few books, that seemed to fall apart.
    I personally would have preferred more narrative cohesion written in the form of a single voice, but I also understand that this is more of a collection of books. 
    There is a definite tonal shift between the Old Testament and the New Testament which was interesting to see.
    Focus on Egypt and Babylon switches to that of Rome and away from the Israelites.
    The Book of Revelations was radically different from what followed before which was also something of interest.
    What is quite fascinating is how certain aspects of religion seem to be followed today while others are mainly ignored in their modern incarnation.
    I also find it interesting that although this also functions as a historical chronicle of sorts, books following the New Testament were excluded or simply not written.
    I am interested in reading the sequel to see what that changes and builds upon in comparison to this after I complete Milton's Paradise Lost so that I can have a well rounded understanding of Abrahamic religion.

    This is a great book despite it not being the most technically impressive work.
    Prose is simple, organization is straight forward, and all you have is story.
    What it offers in terms of story is one that is emotionally charged within the context of world war II era Germany.
    In that sense, it is effective. It does what it needs to do and nothing else.
    The most innovative aspect is that the narrator is death itself.
    Outside of that, characters are well built, and there are no major flaws that I could note.
    I understand now why this is recommended in literary circles.

    This is a visual novel style game from the Super Famicom era that was a sort of pseudo sequel to Chrono Trigger.
    Gameplay is completely text based and involves navigating a manor while solving puzzles, interacting with characters and fighting random battles.
    Since it is text based, I recommend drawing up a map as you travel around since there is nothing to spatially anchor the player other than textual descriptions.
    The story is interesting, and the way in which it ties in with Chrono Trigger is clever.
    Gameplay is engaging despite being minimalistic, and music is great despite technical limitations.
    It definitely brought back memories of Chrono Trigger despite it having a very short playtime.

    This felt like a continuation of events and it is difficult to see where things are going.
    There is character development and the antiwar themes continue, but the episodic format of the original series seems to show in its conversion to a film format despite changes made.

  explanation: >
    A very relevant novel given the impact of Covid-19, but while this is a book about a plague, it is an allegory for something else.
    Apparently this was more about humanity, death, and inspired by World War II.
    While the relationship to World War II seems more related to propaganda, musings on humanity and death are easier to see during a reading.
    The prose is thoughtful, and compared to other works by Camus it also seems quite clinical in its descriptions of events due to Dr. Bernard Rieux intending to be as objective as possible.
    While I prefer The Stranger, this offers its own take on madness, group dynamics, how people behave under extreme circumstances, and much more.
    It is a high quality work that is not the same as the other writings of Albert Camus and adds to the diversity of his body of work.

    This is a musing on what life is, what it is meant to be, and also a murder mystery.

    While Crime and Punishment is more straight to the point, this can be a bit more abstract.
    That is not to say that it is unorganized. Each part has a point and a purpose.
    In that sense, it is very well structured.
    However, it is unconventional in most senses and yet manages to be comprehensible and profound.
    Dostoevsky strikes again with another banger. Hurrah for Karamazov.

    A great animation about the human condition by Don Hertzfeldt.
    While I was hoping for something closer to the SB-129 episode of Spongebob, this is an interesting exercise in death.
    Animation is not complex, but the way it is put together is unique.
    The use of film in addition to shots that were taken of the real world was something I have not seen much of in modern animation.
    The story telling and narration is good, and it has a sense of humor about it so that it does not take itself too seriously.
    That said, this can be quite the downer of a film if you can think beyond what is being told and shown to you.
    Overall, this is quite profound, and while it does not actively draw conclusions like the works of existentialist philosophers, it at least provokes thought.

    I've seen some more recent offerings in the Macross series, but with this, I finally have some context on the history of the series.
    This is a film that has a lot of charm. All the animation is hand drawn and highly detailed. Action is quite intricate.
    The music is very 80's J-Pop which means that it has its own charm while also coming across as dated at times (particularly with regards to lyricism) when compared to how Japanese music would later evolve.
    The story is interesting, and the plot, while not perfectly paced, is like a fairy tale that takes place in space.
    The concept of using music to end conflict is a central theme of the Macross series, and it can be found here.
    There are some themes involving gender that came across as bizarre and behind the times, but other than that, it was an enjoyable time.

    This isn't the type of film that will be winning awards for anything but the music, but it is a guilty pleasure for those who like planes and 80's music.
    The dogfights are well filmed, and Tom Cruise is perfect in his role.
    The soundtrack is iconic.
    Really, the only parts I did not like that much were when people were involved in them.
    The main stars of this film are the planes, and although all the planes seem to be American models, it is still a good example of dogfighting for the time.
    I would still rank the Ace Combat games as a better experience of dogfighting, but what this has going for it is its 80's charm and tight editing.

    While I have seen some of the non-UC related Gundam series, this is my first foray into the UC timeline.
    Given the fact that this came out prior to Japanese animation reaching maturity in the late 80's, the animation is crude.
    Despite this, it has story elements that make it appealing and entertaining despite its shortcomings.
    The hero's journey here is quite standard, but it backs it up by showing the development of characters and fleshing out a somewhat realistic future.
    Influences from science fiction are apparent with the use of mechas, O'Neill cylinders and other futuristic technologies.
    I can also see how influential this was. This series seems to be a blueprint for many mecha related works that came later on.
    While I question whether this is good since it is more of a compilation lacking an overarching narrative, it was entertaining even now.

    I remember liking The Machinist, so I thought I would like this too because it had the same director.
    While I did like this, it is not quite at the level of The Machinist.
    Part of the reason is because what this is more of a thriller than a psychological film.
    As a thriller, it is well structured and paced despite being quite slow to begin.
    In that sense, it is more of a slow burn, but it is rewarding, and the third act pays off.
    This does not try to be too ambitious, but the use of themes that show up in Crime and Punishment was an interesting touch.

    I read this, because the subject matter was relevant to my industry.
    I should have probably read the title first, because I could not care less about the author and did not find her that interesting.
    In this, a non technical individual works at startups and gets some exposure to start up culture and Silicon Valley.
    While some of her insights about the blind spots of those who work in the bay area are valid, she does not express them all that well or in a coherent manner that would come across as persuasive or meaningful.
    There are some threads here that should have been elaborated on such as the effect of companies on society and the counterproductive nature of the culture.

    This is a story driven puzzle game with horror/supernatural elements.
    The story is emotional, and fascinating from a western perspective.
    There are aspects of Chinese culture such as their attitudes towards death, the use of fireworks at funerals, and occultism that I found very interesting.
    In terms of gameplay, it felt like a game on rails in that none of the puzzles were difficult, and there was not much exploration or freedom in the process.
    For this reason, I think this would have been better if the gameplay were beefed up, or if it were stripped down and the story was given more attention instead.

    Unlike End of Evangelion, this is a bit more explicit, a bit more meta, and somewhat harder to understand without context.
    In this, there is an emphasis on catharsis and coming to terms with who you are.
    In addition to this, this feels like a subtle love letter to 90's era Japan, and many of the influences of Anno such as Space Battleship Yamato, and Gainax's other works.
    The art style which continues the mixture of cgi and 2d animation with almost photorealistic backgrounds continues in this work in a surreal fashion like Dali brought to life, but deconstructs itself towards the end.
    Going into this, I thought I would see something like the human instrumentality project realized, but the ending is quite different.
    I think this will be divisive, but Anno's refusal to be clear about his messaging makes me believe that this is something I will be thinking of well after viewing.
    While End of Evangelion had a greater influence on me, the way in which Anno counter's the depression and suicidal tendencies of the series shows his growth as a creator.
    I would not quite say that he matured, but that he has changed. This is a satisfying, but puzzling ending.

    This is a film about Operation Bernhard.

  explanation: >
    My first Agatha Christie novel.
    This is a mixture of a mystery and slasher type story and it may be the first instance of an "Amongus" type of premise.
    While I did not care for any of the characters, the way in which the plot fit in with the contents of a children's rhyme was very interesting.
    While this was somewhat simple in terms of plot, the plot structure was very clear which can be something of a rarity.
    There is also some themes that are reminiscent of Crime and Punishment.
    Overally, it manages to pack quite a bit in despite its short length.

    Life is unfair, and this story can be taken and applied to many aspects of society beyond the justice system.
    Although this is from an earlier time, it is quite applicable today.
    From bureaucracies, to social ostracization, this is very generalizable.
    This is helped by Kafka's familiarity with legalese as well as the surreal elements of the story.
    Honestly, you could also apply this to being run through the modern healthcare system.
    Overall, I think this is good and can be profound without necessarily being overly explicit.

    This makes Madame Bovary seem pedestrian, and reminded me of what a monolith Russian literature can be.
    While similar in its themes of marriage and adultery, this seems to have more breadth while also using its length to thoroughly examine motivations, events, and show off the culture and ideologies of the time.
    With that said, this is inferior to War and Peace, but this is also trying to do something different with regards to the themes it is tackling.
    In terms of negatives, I think the final part after the death of Anna was underwhelming.
    If it ended as strongly as it started, I think I would consider this to be lacking in any major blemishes.

    This is probably one of the largest modules in Khan Academy, and all of these topics are covered in depth while not necessarily quite reaching the cutting edge.
    The latest and greatest in biotechnology is not covered, but the foundational concepts needed to understand it is.

  explanation: >
    I've had this on my radar for about a decade, so I'm glad to finally watch this film.
    This film really has an indie feel that was unique to films that were unable to take advantage of the technological advance of video software and cameras that we see in most products today.
    Most of the actors had no acting experience, and yet they gave very good performances.
    The special effects are somewhat subdued, but are filmed in an evasive manner such as to hide it, and it surprisingly works.
    There was cgi used, but it is surprisingly very convincing.
    There are many themes that are addressed here from mortality to hurricane Katrina, to climate change, but they are presented in a approachable manner.
    One thing that I wished there was more of was the fantastical elements, but that is a small complaint.
    Overall, this is a unique film that manages to represent the bayou very well while telling a straightforward but compelling story.

    I was originally interested in this due to my interest in Blame!.
    Unfortunately, this is not quite at the same level despite the source material providing a strong foundation.
    There is an interesting premise here of a generation ship traveling through space while fighting aliens.
    With that said, the heavy use of cgi which did not blend in well with the backgrounds turned me off.
    Also, there are a number of cliches here in terms of plot development.
    With that said, that does not mean it isn't fun. At times it does have a Saturday morning cartoons type of vibe.

    This was a divisive one. Animation is on another level, and there isn't a frame that is wasted.
    Everything is done deliberately, and all aspects except for the plot itself are unquestionably well done.
    With that said, I felt lost throughout much of this film, and character interaction felt somewhat limited compared to previous films.
    In that said, it feels like a step down from 2.0 despite not necessarily being bad.
    The largest problem is that when compared with the show, I didn't know why things were happening, and the use of Biblical terminology which has helped in the past only obfuscated things.
    Perhaps this is good and I'm simply unable to comprehend what is going on, but the lack of clarity and shorter runtime makes this feel more like an episode on the journey to the end rather than an important piece of the whole story.

    A short, genre bending animated film about animals on a farm.
    Starting out, I thought this would be a fairly standard movie about animals and humans, but it ended up being about more than that.
    It's about family, about animal experimentation, and there is even a little bit of mysticism in there too.
    The craftsmanship is great with highly detailed backgrounds, fluid animation, and good orchestration.
    All of this is packaged into a short, but effective movie which ultimately ended up being Don Bluth's best work.

    Ready Player One was turned into a film, but this was not, and I consider that to be a crime.
    This novel, while not as large scale as Neuromancer, has a certain countercultural feel to it that made it entertaining despite not being as sophisticated.
    When compared with Neuromancer, this is less cyber in terms of human augmentation, but the use of the metaverse allows for an interesting foray into what the future of the internet would have looked like.
    Things such as Google Earth being predicted a decade in advance is one such accomplishment.
    Conversely, there are aspects of this such as mind viruses that use linguistics and ideas to destroy the mind without the need for cybernetics are quite original.
    The characters were interesting as well, and there was a stylistic edge to this that made it feel very 90's.
    From katanas to skateboards to nuclear submarines, this was a fun ride that didn't get too emotional, but managed to explore an interesting world that isn't too different from ours today.

  explanation: >
    This is an analysis of the element of play in culture.
    This book manages to successfully argue that there is a aspect of play in almost all of human behavior while broadening what play actually is.
    From language to philosophy to competition, the concept of play pervades our daily lives at a micro and macro scale.
    This is the crux of what this book is trying to get at, and it makes a strong case.
    One aspect that I wish could have been elaborated on is the unclear division between play and seriousness.
    Similarly, seeing how old this work is, I would be interested in seeing how it applies to modern forms of media and the internet.
    Overall, a surprisingly well written work about an area that is more important than I originally thought.

    It is great to see mainland China create animated donghua works that push the boundary of the genre.
    I don't know if Chinese donghua get a larger budget than Japanese anime, but the animation here is more fluid, and the use of modern techniques allows for sophisticated lighting within 2d environments.
    The opening with its rotoscoped tutting is unskippable, and the score is good as well.
    The premise and concept is original and quite fitting in a modern setting and within the urban fantasy genre.
    The ability to view the past and perhaps change it by diving into photos is unique.
    Character development is good.
    I think this is proof that Chinese writers are beginning to understand how to tailor narratives to a mass audience.
    I'm definitely looking forward to the next season seeing how this ended on a cliffhanger.

    This is some next level stuff and this film represents the departure of the remakes from the show.
    Unlike the show which took its time, to a somewhat infuriating degree, this is a film which means that pacing is more streamlined.
    When compared to the first film which did not have as much character development as I would have preferred, this was made as a film with its own unique plot developments from the very beginning which meant that Anno could plan in development and pacing from the outset.
    This means that it works where the previous film may have stumbled, and it is simply great.
    The new character of Mari Illustrious Makinami was an interesting development, and I am curious to see what she adds to the plot development in future films.
    Music by Shiro Sagisu is at the level of previous entries with aspects of his more recent style making an appearance such as the use of choirs.
    Animation is great with cgi and 2d animation blending very well. You can really get an idea for the scale at which everything takes place, and Anno's fetish for electric cables is present here as well.
    The plot is handled incredibly, and the imagery is just as profound as it was in other entries.
    This is not quite at the level of End of Evangelion, but this touches upon human instrumentality quite early despite there being two movies left in the series which means that this has a chance to go deeper into its themes and be more audacious than the show.
    I'm looking forward to the later entries.

    Another film with the time loop mechanic.
    Unlike Groundhog Day, this has a more modern take in a different setting that acts as a deconstruction of romantic comedy tropes.
    Because this has Andy Samberg's sensibilities, it does feel like Groundhog Day even though it hits some similar notes.
    At the same time, it asks questions about life in general that even Groundhog Day never did.
    Overall, it is quite enjoyable, but towards the shorter side which results in the third act being quite short.
    I think adding about ten minutes may make it better as you can't have too much of a good thing.

    I liked Pride and Prejudice, but I found the humor here to not be as entertaining, and the content matter to be somewhat boring.
    Getting into the financial matters of marriage, and watching characters make mistakes out of pure naïvety is not entertaining.
    In fact, it is frustrating which may be effective for a comedy, but the humor here did not really connect for me.
    With that said, the prose is great, and it reads extremely well.
    Because of this, it is hard for me to dismiss this work, because I can tell that there has been a fair bit of thought placed into the comparison between sense and sensibility.
    But, with a modern lens, there are many aspects here that may come across as unrelatable especially when taking cultural shifts into account.

    A really cool film with a interesting premise and a vast and detailed world.
    It is easy to get lost in the backgrounds and that is almost enough to make up for the weak plot for me.
    The cgi characters don't work for me, but everything else in the background did. The closest thing I could think of in terms of the world here are some of the infinite environments within Manifold Garden.
    This, combined with the great soundtrack which channels in the spirit of John Williams at times with sweeping melodies made it an enjoyable time for me.
    The character of Killy reminded me of westerns and if the film played up some of the tropes from the genre, this could have been improved.
    The concept of self building cities and humans losing the ability to manipulate the technology they built themselves is somewhat original, but I have never seen it done in film before.
    Overall, I liked this and thought it had a lot of potential and if a sequel comes out, I will watch it. With that said, I don't think I can say that this is a good film due to weak characterization and simple plot.

    A24 seems to make consistently interesting films.
    This one feels stylistically like a cross between Jodorowsky and Kubrick.
    While it is portrayed as a horror and slasher film, I think this works more as a psychological one.
    Cinematography is very interesting and unique. There isn't a shot that looks terrible.
    Florence Pugh's acting is on another level here.
    In terms of concept, I imagine this is similar to The Wicker Man, but the Scandinavian aspects of it kept it unique.
    There are some fascinating viewpoints here on human relationships which I think could have been developed further.
    Pacing, despite being slow, works for this film. Overall, I think this is a film I will be revisiting at some point.

    While I can appreciate how this was written and organized, the contents of the story itself were not that enjoyable or profound for me.
    Honestly, if you want to see how a person's actions lead to their own ruin, there are many better stories out there.
    If you want something better, there are the Shakesperean plays.
    Conversely, if you want something newer, there is reality television.

  explanation: >
    This is a book where Hideo Kojima presents a number of works that were formative in his creative expression.
    I thought this was quite similar to the types of books that film reviewers might author, but unlike those, this provides some background on the personal meaning those works had.
    In addition to this, often times, there is a narrative where we are brought back to a time where Kojima was younger to provide additional context.
    I found a lot of overlap with Kojima's influences and Anno's influences which was quite interesting.
    As a work of literature, I don't think this is anything special, but since I had interest in the subject matter, I considered it worthwhile.

  explanation: >
    A hard read, but also a rewarding one.
    In this, Kierkegaard analyzes despair and how it relates to the self.
    I found the subject matter here quite interesting due to how it closely ties in with human identity.
    In many ways, this is on the cusp of discussing Jungian concepts, but it never quite gets there due to its preoccupation with Christianity and God.
    I think the concept of the destruction of the self and the finite life becoming at odds with the infinite were profound with regards to the suffering that is involved in the act of despair.
    There was also some interesting theological commentary on how Jesus is God's example for all of humanity.
    There is also the implication that humans should allow themselves to be crucified which is an interesting one.
    Overall, I think this made much more of an impression on me than Fear and Trembling.

    This is an English language film that takes place in Germany towards the end of the second world war.
    Some actors use a German-ish accent while others don't even try and just have a New Zealand accent.
    Taika Waititi is completely trolling in this film in that he is precise in some details and other details completely go out the window in terms of historical accuracy.
    This works for comedic purposes and I did laugh often in this film.
    At the same time, this also clashes a bit with the heavy subject matter.
    While this results in some level of inconsistency, it seems to be handled with enough sensitivity that it is not a large problem.
    I think acting was pretty good especially with Taika Waititi as Hitler.

    From a design perspective, it seems to have been play tested extensively, because everything seems to happen for a reason.
    There is an interesting sanity mechanic based on how often you are in the darkness which I consider to be quite unique.
    The story is supernatural and bordering on cosmic horror, but not anything ground breaking in my opinion.
    When compared with other horror games like Silent Hill 2 and the aforementioned SOMA, I don't think this matches the atmosphere I expect from horror games.
    I also think the setting and story did not impress me, but it was good overall and quite good for an indie studio.

    I consider this to be an American reply to Farewell My Concubine.
    However, while Farewell My Concubine also managed to show the growth and development of a country, this film takes place on a smaller time scale of about two decades.
    Like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, this has great shots of the locations, and shows how beautiful North America can be as well as capture the feel of rural America.
    Acting is great. I think Heath Ledger was the best with his ability to show a range of emotions without speaking much in the film.
    The film plays like a good book and does not overstay its welcome. It seems to be the right length despite being meandering in nature.
    Overall, quite well crafted and definitely unique for its time.

    This is a strange, but great mind bending novel that was published more than half a century ago.
    I like to think of this as a cross between X-men and Inception where psychic abilities are used for corporate espionage, there are moon bases, and people can live on after death so long as they are not brain dead.
    The concept of half-life where you can live after your body dies and still communicate with the living is very interesting and reminds me of a conversation within Waking Life.
    The idea of trying to figure out who is dead and who is not, what simulated life after death is like is profound, and allows for all rules of reality to go out the window.
    Not only does Phillip K. Dick play with simulation and reality here, but he also plays with time.
    I'm very surprised that a film of this has not been created yet when the source material is this good.

  explanation: >
    I'm not usually a fan of British literature from this time period, but this story read easily in a way that is quite similar to the works of Dickens.
    Specifically, this very much reminded me of Great Expectations. However, unlike that book which had a benefactor, this one emphasized the autonomy of its protagonist.
    While it can be said to be ahead of its time by providing Jane Eyre with the strength to stick to her principles, I think it should be noted that the lessons learned here are not just feminist, but human.
    Each chapter reads well, and it's hard to get bored despite the contents of each chapter being filled primarily with drama.
    Where this excels is in the emotional challenges of all the characters involved to the point that all of them are understandable.
    This is a full package of a story with an arc starting from childhood, a full journey, and a romance that I think should be crowd pleasing.
    Victorian England, despite its wealth, truly did suck due to the effects of industrialization, and the suffering and joys that could be seen during the era were well depicted here.
    I can see why it is considered great, but I would not quite put it at the top of my list of greats with works like War and Peace or The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
    Similarly, while I think Wuthering Heights might be the better novel produced by the Brontë sisters, I did enjoy this far more.

    This is like a South American equivalent to Heart of Darkness, and it handles itself very well.
    This is a great movie, and I understand why it served as inspiration for Apocalypse Now.
    While Apocalypse Now may have been more explicit about its themes, Werner Herzog does a lot of show don't tell, which means that the actions of the characters speak for themselves.
    The filming onsite adds a layer of authenticity to the setting.
    While all the characters speak German instead of Spanish, this does not take too much away from the film, and the acting of Klaus Kinski is among the highlights.
    Overall, this is a great story of greed that focuses on unique characters much like Herzog's other works.

    The final book in the Pendragon series.
    While I am glad I finished the series, I think I would have enjoyed this more when I was younger.
    With this final book, we see questions answered, and final conflicts on a larger scale with a fair bit of fanservice.
    References to previous books are high in number, so I think anyone who reads the series will find themselves to be adequately rewarded.
    With that said, the way in which the multiverse is used was not quite as strategic or as philosophical as I would have preferred, and visions of other worlds and futures felt lacking in terms of depth.
    Pacing and events in the plot felt as though they were not organized in a way that necessarily made sense, and characters sometimes did things that felt shallow or unintelligent.
    Finally, the exposition dump that was provided at the very beginning of the book that was attempting to answer questions brought up in previous books was simply clumsy.
    Overall, I consider this quite flawed, but it may satisfy its target audience.

  explanation: >
    This is a movie that focuses on Batman as a detective which is something that got brushed over in other films, so it is refreshing to see.
    Pattinson makes for a convincing young Batman.
    Cinematography is great, but they might have gone too heavy on the grainy aesthetic as there are often shots that lack clarity of image.
    Editing is good, and it is a slow burn, but it could have definitely been shorter without much lost in the process.
    Music by Michael Giacchino is orchestral and melodic which is just how I like it.
    Acting is great with Paul Dano as The Riddler being the standout performance.
    The overall tone of this is gritty an realistic, but not necessarily in the same manner as the Nolan films which makes it unique in its own right.
    The concept of fear as a weapon is interesting and Machiavellian, but I wish it was explored more.
    I also wish there was some stronger emphasis on overarching themes or more detailed character development.
    I think this and the length of the film are its biggest flaws, but it is a good movie that is very well made.

  explanation: >
    A great continuation from part 1 with a few surprises that brings it full circle with the first season in a way that is inspired by Greek and Norse mythology, but a fair bit of it does seem predictable at times.
    The first half is great as it continues from a cliffhanger, and has a few mindbending aspects such as time manipulation through memories of the future.
    The second half is after the rumbling begins is surprisingly slower as it is trying to deal with the fallout of the rumbling.
    From an animation standpoint, I am surprised how well the cgi blends in with the normal 2d animation to the point that I am often unable to tell the difference.
    Action is great too, and it manages to do some fairly novel things in terms of how time and movement is represented within animation.
    From a story standpoint, this is fairly consistent with the previous entry, but the political maneuvering has been replaced with more commentary on freedom, fate, conflict, morality and genocide.
    I think the question asked in this work of whether humanity is an existence that deserves to live is quite profound is quite applicable to today.
    Music by Yamamoto Kouta is consistent with the quality from the previous entry, and at times meets or exceeds the quality of Sawanou Hiroyuki's work.
    Overall, I think the first half is absolutely terrific, and the second half, while great, is a bit of a slow burn. This series is still a must watch.

    A great political drama that takes place within a fictional country where the police are corrupt and actively interfere with political opposition to the current regime.
    Apparently this was based off of Greece, but there were many elements that were quite similar to what can be found in the history a number of Latin American countries as well.
    The references to foreign interference from outside countries made it feel quite real.
    The way in which those in the inside who are trying to fix corruption and determine the truth are obstructed is quite realistic as well.
    Camera work and the way in which the camera moves really places the viewer in the moment and it is a very modern style of cinematography.
    It starts a bit slowly, but it picks up after the initial parts are established, and it it carries itself with moderate momentum to the end afterwards.

    A simple atmospheric horror game that takes place in a submarine with an interesting premise.
    The tank controls, while frustrating, are not something I am new to and manage to be an interesting mechanic in a game where you cannot see the outside world.

  explanation: >
    This is a work that builds off of works of Peter Wessel Zapffe, Schopenhauer, and other philosophers in addition to drawing from writers of works of horror like Lovecraft.
    What I like about this is its modern take on the topics of the meaningless of life with elaboration on the human-centric abstraction of meaning, as well as coverage of antinatalism.
    The recognition of the idea that life has worth is based on societal concepts and has no backing through some form of empirical basis is quite profound in nature.
    The breaking down of societal concepts that sees life as insignificant on the cosmic scale and miserable on the human scale is quite similar to what can be found in Buddhism.
    With that said, tangents on works of horror, while relevant, seemed to weaken arguments and the focus of the book.
    Overall, I consider this to be good while imperfect.

    America has changed quite a lot compared to the 50's, and I think that is part of the reason why I had trouble relating to this.

    I, on the other hand, found the characters to be uninspiring.
    This meant that the book, as a whole, was a bit of a slog.
    And since America has changed over the decades, even if I wanted to have experiences similar to the ones described in this book, it is unlikely that I can.

    An experimental and somewhat surreal film that plays with time such that past and future are indistinguishable.

    The images on screen are vivid and framed in an expert manner.

    This one of the few games I've seen where you can undergo debates and dialogues about morality.
    There is also some coverage of the connection between religions practiced by different civilizations.
    From a gameplay perspective, you'll find yourself performing different actions to achieve different results in each loop, but the game creates shortcuts to save time as you make progress.

    I saw Batman Returns a long time ago, but never this film until now.
    Compared to the Nolan films or some of the animated offerings, this is nothing special, but I imagine it felt new for the time.
    Elfman's soundtrack and Burton's aesthetic make for a unique Gotham.
    Special effects are quite good, and the scale models, while coming across as fake at times are rather detailed.
    The film starts off slow and does not really explore motivations, but it does have minor character arcs.
    In this sense, it felt like a compromise between a darker aesthetic and the Adam West Batman show.
    There is also some goofy dialog.
    Actors handle the material quite well with Michael Keaton handling his clunky suit quite well given the circumstances and Jack Nicholson delivering the aforementioned goofy dialog with flourish.

    This is, in my opinion, in addition to being the game I enjoyed the most so far this year, it is also the best game I played so far this year.
    Compared to previous Sigono games which were admirable given what the indie studio had to work with, this is a full fledged game that is indicative of a studio that has reached full maturity and it is a great game regardless of the budget or resources.
    The narrative is incredible and it feels like a cross between Dune, the works of Makoto Shinkai, and Journey.
    The premise of memories and emotions being carried across time along with a universe that has a deep lore and history makes for a story that stands out.
    Where Dune has spice, this has lumen which is influenced by sound.
    Needless to say, when gameplay is based on sound, the sound design has to be great and it is.
    The soundtrack is also great, and it follows a more melodic approach in a manner which is similar to many Japanese works which is growing more rare in modern scores.
    Gameplay, while not being particularly innovative, is smooth and moves the narrative forward without being obvious nor being a drag.
    There is a mixture of exploration, resource management, and dice rolling which is not mechanically heavy, but relatively fresh and manages engagement.
    Overall, I consider this to be proof that a great story can be told in a game and that games can easily rival other mediums of storytelling.
    If there is one Sigono game you play, it should definitely be this one.

    This is an entertaining and beautifully filmed movie that does not get too heavy while maintaining appropriate levels of suspense to keep it interesting.

    I have been playing this on and off for the past two and a half years, and I am glad to finally finish this.
    Apparently, there is additional content, but I don't think I will complete that any time soon.
    This is an action rpg in the vein of SNES style games with many puzzle style mechanics.
    Game mechanics are well balanced, and can be further tuned with highly customizable difficulty settings.
    The game is filled with content despite being an indie game, and does open world far better than most AAA studios today.
    The game plays with concepts within vrmmorpg's and AI, and while it may not be as heavy on the story as I would have liked, it manages to create the most fully fleshed rendition of a vrmmorpg that I think I have seen so far along with memorable characters.
    Where this shines is in its world, and its gameplay which is terrific. There are some aspects such as isometric platforming in a 2d environment which might have been improved, but this has definitely gone through the ringer in terms of testing.
    I think this sets the standard for what to expect from games in terms of depth of content, and any time a game claims to be open world, it should be compared with this to determine if it fails to meet the mark.

    This is a show that picks up after the ending of The Suicide Squad and in my opinion, it may be better.
    We have more character interactions, funny dialogue, and a great intro that I think most people won't skip due to its originality.
    John Cena and Freddie Stroma are great in this, and many of the characters have arcs and a fair amount of development.
    The similarities to Invasion of the Body Snatchers was not something I liked, but it got events moving so that we could get to interesting situations for the characters.
    Finally, Clint Mansell's music, while subtle, was great as well, and the commentary on 80's hair metal was much appreciated.

  explanation: >
    This is a film about an alien played by Aamir Khan who loses the remote control for his spaceship and has to live among humans in search for it.
    During this time, he discovers the many religions found within India and this becomes the main focus of the film.
    This can be quite funny and generally entertaining, but it hits many of the same notes as OMG regarding religion.
    In that sense, it feels like it brings nothing new in addition to a somewhat familiar premise that can be found in films such as E.T.
    This is a generally enjoyable film that is carried by Aamir Khan, but I think it's not the best film to address this topic nor is it the best comedy directed by Rajkuumar Hirani.

    This is very much in the style of Greek works like the Iliad and Roman works like Aeneid.
    In this, we have a bit of an overarching goal which is to tell the history of the world from its beginnings up to the state of the Roman empire with Augustus.
    It is quite ambitious in nature, but ultimately achieves what it sets out to do.
    I for one did not enjoy it quite as much due to some of my prior familiarity with the source material.
    There is quite a bit of death and murder and rape in this one which can be off putting as well.
    With that said, for the time in which it was written, it is quite an achievement.

  explanation: >
    This felt like an 80's movie and more like a sequel to Tropic Thunder which means that it was a good time unlike the 2016 film.
    Most of the characters in this film are bottom of the barrel DC characters that are smartly written which means that everything felt new.
    The actors made their characters work quite well and had great chemistry as well.
    This had great humor which placed it on the same level as movies such as Deadpool.
    I do question the pacing of the film and felt that it could have been trimmed down, but it is a fun time and showed James Gunn at his most indulgent.
    I don't think this is necessarily the suicide squad concept done right because I have seen it done better, but it is the best live action entry so far.

  explanation: >
    A mini series that ran almost 20 years ago when dinosaurs had more popularity.
    This is a fairly standard adventure story that functions with a lost in another world style premise.
    In this mini-series, dinosaurs did not die out and live on an island with humans.
    The world does not make much sense, but there is good set design to flesh things out.
    Dinosaurs are a mixture of cgi and animatronics and tend to appear quite dated.
    The story and characters could have been written better.
    Overall, not terrible, but I don't consider it good.

    This is a surprising slice of life that manages to be funny and emotional in a way that I don't think I've seen before.
    This short series follows a four year old who is living independently and gets into heavy topics such as child abuse, family, and friendship.
    The format is simple, it does not have a high budget, but it manages to work with what it has to great effect.

  explanation: >
    I question where this movie should have been made or even considered in the first place.
    This is not the Matrix that I am used to, and the music, cinematography, ground breaking special effects that mixed CGI and practical techniques are gone.
    Even the great kung-fu choreography from the previous films are gone.
    It was nice to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss return, but the absence of Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving in particular made this feel incomplete.
    There are many interesting ideas in here that are executed badly.
    I thought there was the potential to draw from modern philosophy to modernize the ideas from 20 years ago, but that potential was wasted.
    While I enjoyed some parts and was even impressed at times, this film relies heavily on nostalgia.
    The religious themes from the other films are no longer here, and the commentary on society is neutered compared to the first film.
    It tries to hit some familiar notes, but it's just not the same.
    At the very least, it is self aware, and I don't regret watching it.

  explanation: >
    This is probably among the best live action Spider-Man films and it is my favorite within the Home trilogy.
    What this film does is not necessarily revolutionary, but it is a crowd pleaser that feels just like a Marvel comic.
    We see things in this film that we would have thought was impossible given the state of Hollywood 10 years ago.
    In this, we see the appearance of all three spidermen that made an appearance over the past 20 years, and most of the villains.
    We also see some familiar faces from the Dr. Strange side of things.
    I guess if there was something I would have preferred more of, it was the banter between characters.
    I felt they could have gone further with the character interactions which is what I consider to be the main strength in these Marvel films.
    With that said, the movie was already long enough, so it may be the case that there was much that needed to be cut.
    Overall, this is a good conclusion to a trilogy that, while it does not do anything profound in its messaging, manages to appeal to fans and do justice to the hero's journey.

  explanation: >
    I remember reading up to the third book as a child, and always wanted to finish the series, but never got around to it.
    Now that I've reread everything and finished the last book in the cycle, I can understand why.
    Everything is too long and Paolini is not Hemingway, so it is to be expected that mistakes made are more obvious than they would be under typical circumstances.
    Dialogue is one area that I found to be questionable and it felt stilted and seemed to convey a lack of understanding of the English language, both modern and old.
    That said, it is clear to see how Paolini managed to improve through each book, and the way in which the cycle ended, while leaving much to be desired, was an ending that I believe only a more mature writer would come up with.
    World building and lore was interesting and there are some good ideas here.
    The ability to fight through one's thoughts could have been used to a greater effect in a philosophical sense, but was only used as mechanic here which was disappointing.
    It was also good to see that there was inspiration taken from many Germanic languages when coming up with the names of places and people.
    With regards to originality, this felt like a cross between a watered down Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, but this felt as though it hit some notes better than the sequel trilogy of Star Wars.
    I think overall, this is a flawed series, but it is clear that a substantial amount of work had went into it, and I'm sure that a younger audience would appreciate it.

  explanation: >
    I remember reading the first book of the series and being intrigued by its premise. I was hoping this film would bring back such feelings, but that was not the case.
    This is an example of great ideas being wasted due to bad execution.
    From a craftsmanship perspective, only the work by Weta Digital and Junkie XL was worth redeeming.
    There are great sets and environments, but the editing is so fast paced that you don't have time to take them in.
    Everything else from the cinematography to the frantic editing and the world building was lacking.
    When there are films like Fury Road which can be taken as inspiration for a post apocalyptic world that feels post apocalyptic, this falls short.
    The moving city of London is disappointing, and nothing like modern London.
    The world is not scorched into a wasteland like I thought it would be after the 60 minutes war.
    Many characters are underdeveloped with some side characters participating in subplots that don't go anywhere.
    This had potential to be decent, but it felt like a waste of a budget.

  explanation: >
    This is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed II, and it continues the story of Desmond Miles and Ezio Auditore.
    Compared to the Assassin's Creed II which is the best of the series, this is fairly consistent in terms of quality albeit it is lacking slightly in comparison with the game preceding it.
    Unlike the previous game where you have a story told in multiple cities during the Renaissance, this one only takes place in Rome.
    There are a lot of side distractions which can be fun I guess, but the main story line is not as involved.
    This time, we are dealing with Cesare Borgia as the main antagonist, and he isn't really anything special despite being plucked out of history and being the inspiration for Machiavelli's The Prince.
    I prefer my antagonists to be memorable, but he is not.
    The overarching story with Desmond Miles and aliens is disappointing as always, and it might be better to have had his part completely removed.
    The music is on par with the previous entry, but this is because Jesper Kyd returned and recycled much of his previous work.
    Overall, it does nothing wrong, and is consistent in quality but not content with its predecessor. If you want to see Rome during the Renaissance, this could be for you.

  explanation: >
    I watched the first 3 seasons, and that's all I plan to watch for now as there seems to be a slight downward trend in quality despite fairly clever writing.
    I haven't seen a lot of media that takes place within a community college, so that is fairly novel to me.
    In addition to that, this actually made community college seem appealing at times which is somewhat impressive as well.
    The comedy is quite meta and this is probably a result of Dan Harmon being involved and the many pop cultural references.
    In addition to this, there are some other big names such as the Russo brothers and Ludwig Göransson lending their skills.
    The acting is nothing spectacular, but good enough to sell the jokes and make the characters each actor's own personal work.
    Each of the actors here had something to offer with the main study group and the dean having the largest impact.
    Overall, very enjoyable, self aware, and meta.

    This was a surprise going in. It starts off with a man going to court against God before ultimately teaming up with God to take on organized religion.
    From a craftsmanship perspective, the camerawork and other aspects are nothing special.
    But the script is well handled, and the pacing is great.
    It is stylized and entertaining in a way that is not overbearing.
    This is something that Bollywood finds hard to do, so I was pleasantly surprised.
    It's a well written story that does not get bogged down in the typical glamor and set pieces that may be seen in Indian films.
    And if that is not enough to sell this, there is even a cameo by Prabhu Deva.
    Overall, it definitely is not perfect, but it is a fun time and even thought provoking given how open minded it can be at times.

    This is one of those comedy dramas where everything goes wrong for the characters.
    The character interactions and the actors playing the members of the dysfunctional family that comes together at the end of this film are what sells it for me.
    In addition to the script, the satirizing of the American dream, vanity, and child beauty pageants all within the context of a road trip make for a a interesting and unique film.

    An indie rpgmaker game that takes inspiration from games like FF6 and Chrono Trigger, but does not quite match or is in the same realm as those games.
    The setting of a world that is floating up in the sky is interesting and it has a very promising ending, but everything lacks depth compared to their Japanese counterparts from the SNES era.
    It is a good attempt for an indie game that has the bare minimum needed to be enjoyable, but I found that from the combat to the world to the story, everything except the exploration was lacking in some way or form, but not in content.
    There is a lot of content, and a good progressing that keeps grinding to a minimum, and you don't need to spend hours upon hours on it like Final Fantasy.

  explanation: >
    This is the second entry in Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy.
    This one focuses on the aftermath of the court proceedings we got a glimpse of in the previous film Blue.
    In this film, the protagonist wishes to achieve equality after being placed into poverty due to divorce and achieves it through revenge.
    This is a very strange film, and part of the reason for that is due to it being a comedy-drama.
    With that said, I did not find this funny at all, but it was still engaging due to the way in which the plot progresses in a somewhat stilted way and the visual language.
    Despite this having a focus on the color white, the colors are vibrant, which separates it from black and white films that did similar things in the past.
    Although this does not quite match up to Blue, it is good, and it maintains a certain level of quality that is consistent with the previous entry.

    The fact that this exists is quite surprising, but the fact that it is good is an even bigger surprise.
    From an animation standpoint, this is quite impressive with its mixture of 3d and 2d which is reminiscent of the strides made in Into the Spiderverse.
    Characters are incredibly expressive the art style feels like it has reached full maturity already with the first season.
    The story, while not perfect in its pacing, is well done with character interactions and world building being the main strengths.
    The way in which the characters and the world from League of Legends develop over time is handled quite well.
    For me, the main strengths of this work are best shown when it takes a more stylized approach in its presentation of material.
    The weaknesses tend to show in sections where the writing is less detailed or less deliberate.
    I think, while this is a great start to an interesting story, it can be tighter, further streamlined, and perhaps have a more sweeping scale.
    Overall, I consider this to be an achievement in western animation, and a good start to a story that I hope improves over time.

    This is a film about the Montreal massacre of 1989.
    From a narrative perspective, this is above average. It does not do anything special, nor does it have time to do anything special due to the short runtime, but it still manages to weave an interesting narrative in the later half.
    Where this excels is its visual style which I believe to be perfect.
    There is not a shot here that is wasted, and despite it being black and white, each frame is clear and vibrant.
    While this is not Villeneuve's best work, it is still quite good, and it does what it sets out to do.

    A biographical film about track and field sprinter Milkha Singh who was also known as The Flying Sikh.
    This has great moments and moments where I have questioned what the director was thinking.
    The primary reasons for this is the structure in which the story is told which is in the form of flashbacks and due to it being a Bollywood film which means that it is overly long, and people break out into song at weird places.
    The moments that work for me are character driven and a greater focus on character interactions may have helped the film.
    This is a biographical film after all.
    There are are also some shortcomings in terms of special effects with some green screen effects coming across as incredibly obvious.
    When it does work, however, it can be inspiring, and the music helps.
    Overall, it is a mixed bag that has moments when it shines.
    I think many may consider this a good movie, but I found the narrative to not have as tight a focus as I would have preferred.

    This suffers from pacing issues and the usual Bollywood melodrama, which means that it is not quite at the level of the previous entry in the series.
    With that said, it keeps its humor, and as a result is quite enjoyable.
    For those who are expecting a sequel, this story might come as a surprise, because it is not a continuation of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., but it does have many of the same characters.
    Despite it having no continuity, I think this works, because while the previous was about being a doctor, this is about Ghandi's practices being applied in the modern world.
    Since the two premises have nothing to do with each other, I believe the approach taken here, while lacking in terms of execution, ultimately works.

    More than a decade after multiple works like Battle Royale and Kaiji in Japan, South Korea has its own approach to the high stakes games genre and takes a bit from the Hunger Games to add additional social commentary.
    This is well executed with great set design and camera work, but the selling point is the acting and all of the actors do very well in their roles.
    The use of popular childrens games in South Korea is an interesting touch that adds to the appeal.
    There are some plot points that add to suspense such as the use of an undercover cop, but ultimately end up going nowhere other than to serve as foreshadowing which may be somewhat disappointing.
    When the subplots are ignored, what we have is an interesting drama that unfolds by placing characters in interesting situations where their morality is forced into conflict with their personal needs.
    It should also be noted that themes regarding capitalism and class inequality have been gradually making their way to the forefront in South Korean media, and this is one example of such media that manages to be coherent in its messaging.
    Overall, while this is not a perfect show, it is well crafted, and in all reality, I would not be surprised if games like this existed in real life.
    Although this could have ended satisfyingly at one season, the ending leads directly to a possible second season.

  explanation: >
    While this is viewed as part of stoic philosophy, I think what makes this different and profound is its understanding of the feeling of control.
    Epictetus notes that perceived control is what determines how we feel about something regardless of whether that thing is in the past, present, or future.
    Once one loosens the grip, any emotional restraints that come with the concept of control are gone as well.
    It is similar to many philosophers talking about internal states and responses to external stimuli.
    How you choose to respond to things and whether you choose to be affected by things determines how those things will ultimately affect you.
    There is also coverage of the temporary nature of things and that all things will be lost eventually.
    While this could mean that you should not take things for granted, you can also view those things as borrowed.
    I.E., they were never yours to begin with.
    Overall, quite good especially when considering its short length.

    This is a wacky comedy about a gangster trying to become a doctor.
    The premise alone is quite interesting, and the above average execution allows for it to be a Bollywood success.
    This also led to the making of remakes in other languages such as Vasool Raja MBBS.
    While this does not excel at anything in particular, it manages to do well because it does not take itself too seriously.
    Because of this, I think I may have enjoyed this more than 3 Idiots.

    A game that breaks the fourth wall and can only be played once unless you change a few files on your computer.
    Inclusion of manipulating files on your computer to progress in the game is fairly novel.
    Among games that do such a thing, Undertale comes to mind, but in terms of gameplay, this is more like a 2d rpg.
    On the first playthrough you are allowed to choose between two endings.
    However, to get the true ending, you have to have a second playthrough.
    I highly recommend doing the full run instead of stopping after the first playthrough, because there is a greater sense of closure with the true ending.
    Overall, I found that it is a highly memorable and interesting game that makes you attached to the characters in it and forms interesting questions about game worlds, simulations, and desires.

  explanation: > 
    More than 2 years after the 2019 presentation, this presentation has been made to as an update on the status of Starship to provide some clarity on revised timeframes.
    Compared with the 2019 presentation, we have a fully stacked starship configuration in the backdrop this time instead of just the Starship prototype.
    The Raptor has a new version with fewer parts and more thrust which means higher robustness with higher performance and lower cost.
    With this presentation, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oox2w5sMcA" target="_blank">new rendering and animation</a> of the stack as well that showcases launch and landing changes and a reversion with regards to how starships will mate for refueling in orbit.
    Overall, it is good to see the progress made, but based on the rate of progress, I am concerned that we will most likely miss the Q3 Mars launch window for 2022.
    The lack of information on the governmental side of things like the FAA is concerning as well especially regarding environmental impact assessments (EA) vs environmental impact statements (EIS).
    Finally, it looks like while the stack and manufacturing is progressing, the lack of information on the life support systems and internals for long haul flights make it seem as though manned flights are a long way away.

    With this, I have completed the three flavors cornetto trilogy.
    Of the trilogy, I think I enjoyed this the most.
    Like other Edgar Wright works, this has great cinematography, tight pacing, and tight editing.
    This film is a combination of the most epic of pub crawls, a mid life crisis, and science fiction story.
    In many cases, it feels like Attack the Block, but with better craftsmanship.
    Simon Pegg's acting in this is the best I've seen from him out of all the entries in the trilogy.
    Overall, I found this to be a great time and a greatly constructed film.

    This short is over 100 years old and showcases Buster Keaton's comedic sensibilities.

    While the animations are episodic and don't add much to the lore, they do show a different approach to the material with a unique artstyle that the more recent live action entries don't come close to.
    While I watched this in Japanese, there may be some animations that may be better to watch with an English dubbing if they contain some familiar characters from the movies and shows.

    A modern game about photography that seems like it stepped out of the 90's and has inspiration from Maori culture/history.
    Graphics are like something out of PS1, N64 or Dreamcast and music is like something out of Jet Set Radio, but it is completely original and has its own unique tonality and approach.
    Compared to other games that deal with photography, this is not on rails, and you get full control of the camera.
    From different lenses to post processing, this can make for a somewhat decent primer on beginner level photography.
    The environments you can photograph are vibrant and feel like something out of Evangelion or Akira with a color pallete that matches that specific generation of anime.
    It is beautiful and the game feels like a curated art installation that you might purchase a ticket to experience.
    As you photograph different objects and progress through different environments, you get to also experience a story that is told indirectly.

    This feels like a cross between the two with the western aesthetic and a story that has similarities to Lone Wolf and Cub.
    At the same time, it feels like an original take especially when compared with the sequels.
    While this is a show with an episodic format with fillers, it still manages to be superior to the prequels and the sequels.
    In addition to this, I felt like the acting in this was superior to the acting in some of the entries in the original trilogy.
    Overall, I think most people that watch this will be quite satisfied.
    This apparently has connections to the animated Star Wars series, so I'm curious what fans of that may think.

    A very British comedy that spoofs the zombie genre.
    This is quite well handled and the comedy is less overt compared to other films and sometimes is obvious and is sometimes subtle.
    There is commentary on society, relationships and good situational humor.
    For some reason, while this did not need great camera work, it had it which is very rare for comedies today.
    Honestly, the cinematography is probably one of the best aspects of this film which is to be expected from Edgar Wright.
    Overall, a very solid comedy that has aged well and has replay value. I consider Hot Fuzz to be more enjoyable, but this is quite close in quality.

    Before Austin Powers, there was Stephen Chow's take on James Bond.
    This has a fair bit of good comedy, but the absence of Ng Man Tat was a bit disappointing.

    Despite this being called King of Comedy, this is more about acting, and the mo lei tau style comedy is somewhat subdued compared with other Stephen Chow films.

    If Terrence Malick directed a superhero movie, it might look like this.
    This is the most stylistically unique Marvel film since Guardians of the Galaxy.
    Unfortunately, while this had great potential, the pacing and insufficient character development made for an inconsistent film that does not work.
    This could have been slow and meditative, or more fast paced and thrilling.
    Unfortunately, there is a strange middle ground where the pace of things either feel rushed or dragging in nature.
    Given the approach provided, I think a slower and deeper approach may have worked better like the Snyder cut.
    With that said, the visual aspects of this are very well done.

    This is a book that reads itself and it has an unstopping forward momentum.
    It has a sense of humor while also being a good hard science fiction book.
    In many ways, this felt like a mix of The Martian, and Arrival where communication with an alien species is a mainstay of this novel.
    There are many interesting concepts here (some of which seem like they have been recycled from other sci fi works especially those of Arthur C. Clarke).
    Some of the science does feel a bit loose in terms of the biochemical aspects, but overall, it was a fun time.

    I was hoping for something on the level of Flirting Scholar. Unfortunately, the pacing does not make it work.

  explanation: >
    I was expecting this to be a mini series like all the other Marvel shows, but it turns out that this was just season 1.
    When compared to the other shows, I felt this had higher highs than Wandavision and lower lows which puts it at about the same level in my book.
    While this is a good Marvel entry, it is also a great work of science fiction.
    This show goes all in on the multiverse and the concept of the time variance authority is quite original.
    This makes for interesting scenarios and a good mystery that the main characters need to figure out along with the viewers.
    There are some negatives such as Loki's ridiculously quick character development over the course of a few days which felt a bit inconsistent with the other entries in the MCU.
    There was some filler which was interesting, but if that was cut out, then this could have worked as a movie as well.
    That said, I think this can be easily overlooked since Marvel does often play fast and loose with the details when they are more minor and don't have a direct impact on the plot.

  explanation: >
    This is the first viable competitor to Ace Combat I have seen and it had a development team of 3 people which is crazy.
    That should be kept in mind, because although this is influenced by Ace Combat, it does not quite match it.
    With that said, it does come close and it sometimes exceeds some of the craziest aspects of Ace Combat in its gameplay.
    Dogfights in this game can be frantic with some enemy aircraft shooting hundreds of missiles and many railguns and forcefields which makes dodging a mainstay of this game.
    In that sense, this is Ace Combat on steroids.
    The music is also good and is reminiscent of older Ace Combat entries.
    Where this falls short is in the details and in how the story is delivered.
    Enemy variety and mission variety is limited in comparison to Ace Combat. With regards to the story, everything is told in mission briefings, debriefings, and during missions.
    While cutscenes are not necessary, an approach similar to Ace Combat 4 would have been appreciated to at least provide a human touch to the characters as well as a satisfying ending.
    The themes explored in this story such as private military corporations, and dramatic tectonic activity upending civilization are interesting and could have been explored better in the exposition.
    Overall, this is great, and while this may not measure up to Ace Combat's best, it is not far behind and is definitely better than some of the more mediocre entries in the series.

    The best of the Marvel shows I have seen so far.
    This is great, and it does not feel derivative or formulaic in any way.
    The concept of using sitcom style formats to explain psychological troubles is quite shrewd and meta as it also allows for an overview of the history of American television.
    Acting is well done, and the way in which different eras of sitcoms are reproduced is handled very well.
    In addition to this, all the non sitcom related content made for an interesting mix of genres especially at the beginning where it almost felt as though it was something out of The Twilight Zone.
    Overall, I was quite impressed with this and felt that it managed to work quite well despite only using side characters and being in a mini-series format.

  explanation: >
    This is the second entry in the Opus series and it is great to see indie studios like Sigono have the opportunity to continue with their work.
    Compared to the previous game, this has more gameplay. Music is just as good, and art is simplistic.
    I think the main problems this might have had was with pacing and character development where characters don't change gradually.
    In addition to that, I wish character interactions were more nuanced.
    The premise is very interesting with the concept of space burials during a plague being quite novel and manages to differentiate itself from To the Moon which has somewhat similar themes.
    The concept of using cryosleep to maintain a religion over time and overcome disasters was also an interesting feature of the story that played out in a way that I found to be surprising and well done.
    Overall, I thought that its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.

  explanation: >
    The high production quality makes this seem more like a stretched out Marvel film which works to its disadvantage.
    Works like this which play to thriller genre tropes tend to come across better with tighter editing and pacing which this does not have due to the length.
    In addition to this, while there is good chemistry between the main characters, this lacks some of the humor that I tend to like in Marvel works.
    I would consider this better than Black Widow, but worse than the Captain America films directed by the Russo brothers.

  explanation: >
    I don't usually watch shows, but Marvel movies help me manage stress, so I figured I should try out the shows.
    This is like a Marvel film, but stretched out.
    While production value may be somewhat lower, since a lot of this is more dependent on stunt work instead of cgi, it manages to get away with it.
    It also manages to somehow make a New York where no one is wearing a mask and there is no pandemic seem normal.
    Writing is okay. I was not particularly impressed with it, but I found it enjoyable after turning my brain off.
    Episodes got better later on, and there were some interesting tracking shots during the action scenes.
    The events that happen in the story are low stakes and probably won't affect future films and stories all that much.

    Quite an interesting post-apocalyptic/dystopian science fiction novel.
    The story of what happened to humanity in the distant past and uncovering it piece by piece is reminiscent of many other sci fi stories, but I liked it.
    I imagine when it came out, it was fairly original, but now, there are a number of movies, books, and games that look into the idea of past civilizations out there among the stars.
    Like many scifi offerings, this struggles with characters and development, but compared with works of other authors like Asimov, this is not too bad.

    Quite bad. Lacks substance.
    I found some of the interactions between characters interesting, but the action sequences (especially later in the film) felt like they were shot terribly.
    Lighting in some scenes does not make sense and physics seem to go out the window every once in a while.
    This often times felt like a cheap imitation of a movie from the Bourne series, but they don't deliver on the visceral action like Bourne does.
    People speak English and sometimes Russian despite most characters being supposedly Russian.
    Maybe I might have appreciated this more if it came out after Civil War, but at the moment, I find its positive qualities hard to identify despite the hard work that went into it.

    This was quite fun despite the Marvel formula starting wear a bit.
    This had a great cast which some of the actors like Tony Leung being overqualified for the script.
    Choreography is interesting and strikes a good balance between quick cuts and longer takes which was much appreciated.
    If one was to compare this to other martial arts films, this is definitely not among the best, but it is good and it is a fun time.
    Use of Mandarin and English was interesting, but I'm not sure why a mixture of the two was used at times when only Mandarin or Cantonese was needed or appropriate.

    After dying thousands of times, I have managed to get through the A side of the game which comprises the main portion of this challenging platformer.
    The platforming aspect of this is very well tuned and the A side which constitutes scaling a mountain and achieving inner peace is doable.
    The themes this handles are quite similar to Journey, but unlike Journey, characters speak, interact, and everything is far more concrete which makes it an equal in its own right.
    Art direction and music, while simplistic, are handled well.
    I see this as a Super Mario, but with a story and themes that are far more relevant to players of today and that is quite an achievement.
    While I wished I could have played through the B side, the level of difficulty requires such a high level of precision that it would have doubled or tripled the time I originally placed into the game.

  explanation: >
    This is inferior to 2001, but it is not a bad film by any means.
    The main problem here is that it is not directed by Kubrick and the approach is far more conventional.
    The classical music of the previous film is replaced by 80's synth, the shots are far less deliberate or audacious, and there is more dialogue and exposition.
    In addition to this, while 2001 is timeless in image and ahead of its time with regards to its technology, 2010 is very much a product of its time and it almost seems as though the technology has regressed with larger space suits and older analog electronics.
    One thing I did find charming was the fact that characters had arcs and that there was a focus on the interplay between the Soviets and the Americans.
    It was interesting to see Jupiter get turned into a star, and some of the miniatures and effects were genuinely well done.
    One its own, I may even consider it a good movie due to the strength of the source material. I do recommend it, but it should be noted that it lives within the shadow of its predecessor and removes much of the mystery and ambience that came with 2001.

    Rocketlab is making a larger rocket. This one is similar to the Falcon 9, but it is made of a carbon composite instead of aluminum-lithium alloy.
    As many may know, carbon is difficult to manufacture, but Peter Beck argues that Rocketlab can use it quickly and integrate it easily within their 3d printing process.
    So, if this all works out, we may get a highly reusable rocket with a better benefit cost ratio than the Falcon 9.
    In this case, they also manage to keep the fairing by making it a part of the first stage and hold the second stage.
    It should be noted however, that this rocket design will always land at launch sites instead of sometimes at sea like the Falcon 9 which may limit mission envelopes.
    Based on the profile of its deliverables and payloads, it also seems like it may be shorter than the Falcon 9, but it should also be noted that it is wider and the Archimedes engines have higher impulse and will be lifting a lighter rocket.
    I'm looking forward to see how this compares to Falcon 9 and whether this can be made a reality.

    In this case, much of what is examined is the past, present and future's hold on one's thoughts which are preventing people from living in the moment.
    In many ways, this is covered by Sadhguru's Inner Engineering, but since this predates that work by decades, one can think of this as a more intellectual version of the aforementioned work.

    A great indie game developed by one person.
    As a space sim, this strikes a good balance between casual play and world building such that you don't need to micromanage everything.
    The way the story unfolds adds another dimension to the gameplay, because you have to explore an entire galaxy to piece everything together.
    The general feel of this is as though you were placed in the middle of a Star Trek episode where you meet new races and decide interact with them as you travel through space.
    Really, the only thing that I felt was somewhat lacking was the depth of content, but for one person, this is great.
    If there is a sequel, I would like to see more character interactions and greater rpg style world building, faction building, and character building.

  explanation: >
    The hardest philosophical work I have read and the extensive use of German based terminology such as Dasein did not help.
    The primary concern of this work is to ask what it means to be or exist.
    Heidegger makes references to Hegel, Kant, and Descartes in an attempt to explore this, so prior reading is to be expected.
    In this work, Heidegger calls into question the ontological underpinnings established by philosophers like Kant and Descartes and asks whether an object and its properties can truly be separated.
    Later on, he adds the effect of temporality into the mix to show that existence is a temporal phenomenon.
    While this is not quite as logically dense as Kant, the reasoning provided by Heidegger to jump from one topic to the other looks very much into human perception as a way to explore what existence is, what it means to exist, and intellectual blindspots.
    Because of this, the existence Heidegger analyzes is that of human existence as opposed to existence in general.
    I did not understand everything due to the density of the text and a lack of experience with phemenology, but this is quite an interesting view on human existence and its relationship to time along with the human perspective of time.

    I wanted to get a better understanding of Torchaudio, and this helped with that.
    The code generated within this tutorial is compact and straight to the point which is a plus as well.
    There is a bit of review regarding the Pytorch aspects for training, testing, and predicting, but things like how to process audio prior to loading for training was quite informative.
    The example used here is that of classification of audio. This is good for educational purposes, but I think I would have preferred something more like audio generation as an example instead.

  explanation: > 
    A run through how to make a chat bot using Pytorch and NLP techniques.
    Much of this felt like review to me, but it was interesting to see how the different pieces fit together.
    To put things simply, this is an intent based conversational agent that tokenizes sentences and then constructs a bag of words representation which is used as training.
    Any sentences passed by the user is then used to determine what response to provide by determining the intent using a probabilistic threshold which makes it a classification problem.
    The model used is a simple feed forward network and there was some coverage on how to create a GUI for the project by using tkinter.
    I'd like to try building something similar myself and pair it with a torchaudio model to enable text to speech and possibly speech to text for spoken conversation.

  explanation: > 
    I needed a refresher on Pytorch as well as a full overview of the parts that I have not used in projects in the past.
    This covers the basics needed for the training and testing loops.
    It does not cover stuff like torchvision or torchaudio which can be disappointing, but since this is a beginner course, I suppose that is fine.
    It should be noted that more complex architectures like transformers, autoencoders, deep q learning for reinforcement learning and GANs are not covered either.
    There is coverage of pretty much everything for training from data loaders to optimizers, to learning rate scheduling to Pytorch lightning.
    Pytorch lightning in particular seems quite useful and since I hate dealing with boilerplate, it might be something I would be interested in using myself.
    Overall, useful for jogging one's memory, but I think the best way to really address one's weaknesses is by writing code and running it on collab.
    In my case, the parts that I find to be most troublesome is dealing with tensor shapes and formatting data accordingly for loading data and running predictions.

  explanation: > 
    Quick explanation of what NginX is. Put simply, it is a server that is used for load balancing and can be used as a reverse proxy.
    With regards to what a reverse proxy is, the differences between a proxy and a reverse proxy are not all that distinctive.
    In a reverse proxy the client doesn't know which server it is connecting to (balancer). In a proxy the server doesn't know which client it is connecting from (VPN).
    So, you can have both.

    This is a book that gets brought up frequently in online discussions, so I went into this blind to figure out what all the fuss is about.
    This focuses on free speech and how social trends are leading to a larger populace of people who are more easily offended.
    Given the topic, it raises interesting points on education, personal development, and discourse in a non-partisan way.
    What this book argues for is quite simply to avoid conflict, to assume no ill will when the intents of others are unknown, and to expose oneself to the challenges that one may realistically face rather than avoid them.
    That sentence by itself should be enough, but it manages to take the core premise and turn it into a book when an article may be sufficient.
    I appreciated the use of cognitive behavioral theory due to my own use of it in my research, but also found that this book relies too heavily on it and even simplifies it a bit more than I would prefer.
    Overall, I found this thought provoking despite its flaws.

  explanation: > 
    I am mixed about how much I enjoyed this year's world final, but what I am clear on is that this is one of the most interesting and most meta world finals.
    The camera work was mediocre and the music was probably the most problematic and disappointing part with beat drops and the like being fewer in number and many tracks sounding like simple drum beats on a loop.
    I agreed with most of the judging with Shigekix and Flea Rock being one that I somewhat disagreed with.
    With this world final, we have the first and youngest winner from the U.S. for the bgirls, and for the bboys, we have the first winner from Kazhakhstan and the first winner from the last chance cypher.
    This year seemed to have style clashes as well as clashes with regards to the philosophy by which competitors express themselves which was further exaggerated by the presence of Flea Rock and Nadia.
    There is a clear emphasis given to style, expression and clarity when all else is equal which is quite interesting because in previous finals, physical capabilities and execution made a larger difference.
    In a sense, this is something of a paradigm shift similar to what 2014 was where the previous generation was supplanted by the next and shows that anyone can win the belt.

  explanation: >
    I am quite impressed with this surreal epic and its performance makes me more hopeful for the future of blockbuster cinema.
    I read Dune when I was in middle school and luckily, the only thing I remembered about it was how strange it was.
    This is a story that has deep lore and the way in which exposition is interleaved with visual elements is masterful to the point that I did not even notice it.
    Cinematography and most aspects of the craftsmanship were impeccable.
    Even clothing and costumes were quite thought out and I could trace some of the inspirations.
    Music by Hans Zimmer felt like a cross between Peter Gabriel in The Last Temptation of Christ and A.R. Rahman in Bombay and had a sense of spirituality mixed into its tonality.
    I was not a fan of the heavy use of cgi and would have preferred more practical effects if possible despite the cgi being quite high in quality.
    With regards to acting, there is an ensemble cast of experienced actors who are all accomplished in their own right.
    The primary problems that might be found with this film relate to pacing and what I believe to be insufficient focus on the philosophical and spiritual musings.
    That said, I feel that anyone who could successfully work with this source material and turn a homogenous desert into something more is ranked quite high in my book.
    Overall, quite good in IMAX and now that we have all this build up, part two should have the expected payoff which I am looking forward to.

  explanation: >
    The first entry in the three colors trilogy.
    This is great. Cinematography is on point, music is thought out, and everything is deliberate.
    The closest thing I can think of are the works of Wong Kar-wai, but where Kar-Wai's works can be more dreamlike, this feels more carefully calculated.
    Krzysztof Kieslowski knew exactly what he was doing in every scene.
    This film was meant to cover the color blue and its meaning in the French flag which implied liberty.
    While Kieslowski covers liberty in a more emotional sense, this decision was a shrewd move from a dramatic perspective as it can allow for exploration of character motivations
    The process of grieving along with liberation from emotional chains was handled well with subtlety, and Juliette Binoche as the main character carries much of the film on her shoulders without any misteps.

    This is less like a film and more like a play with advanced staging.
    Camera movement is non-existent or minimal at most.
    It is clear that people were just figuring out how to do things, so there isn't an aspect of this film that does not have holes in it when compared to films today.

    I feel like Voltaire would either be fun at parties or a spoilsport.
    There is no middle ground.
    In this book, there is a happy ending that is completely disappointing.
    Voltaire tries to dismantle and criticize everything.
    He comments on the enlightenment, philosophy, intellectualism, aristocracy, war, wealth and does all of this while his characters travel the world.
    For a short read, it still feels like Voltaire could have been more straight to the point when satirizing everything.
    In that sense, it feels similar to Gulliver's Travels.

    I need to learn how to use OpenCV for computer vision purposes.
    This covered OpenCV from basic image manipulation to recognition using existing libraries.
    The video lasted four hours, but I think most of it was worth the time due to video being a good medium to learn about computer vision.
    Different concepts are split up by chapter within the video making it easy to follow and learn what you specifically want to learn.
    The last lesson may be considered a waste of time due to it going through the deep learning pipeline and utilizing a library developed by the author of the video.
    It is very much a case of the video creator peddling his own goods which would be fine if his libraries were used by many, but that is not the case.

    Covers the basics of React in 30 minutes and does nothing else. This covers a todo list example in particular.
    There is no routing, there is no coverage of single binding and double binding, no CRUD's, and I think most people would be lost if they did not have prior experience with some of the technologies involved.
    While I did understand what was going on, there were some things people won't pick up on such as how binding in React works due to it not being covered explicitly.
    This also did not cover things like best practices. This only covers the main mechanics. I recommend a more in depth overview regardless of whether you are an experienced front end dev or a newcomer.
    What is also not clear is the advantages over Angular, although at face value, React seems easier to pick up.

    I have been considering multiple solutions for hosting a dynamic website with a fully functional backend.
    As I've experienced with Google products in the past, documentation is not that great.
    This video is short enough to cover what Firebase is and the concept of database as a service.
    What it does not show is the full range of functionalities available-- specifically if it is possible to separate business logic from the frontend and have it within Firebase itself.

    This is good, but it does not measure up to the first Creed.
    That said, it is better than many of the Rocky sequels.
    Everyone plays their part well, and the return of Drago was good but underutilized.
    What this lacks is an arc and development with high and low notes.
    It should be noted that even the training montage was weak in this one which was quite surprising.
    It's worth a watch, and it is good, but more than one watching of this work is unlikely.

    I enjoyed this one at times, but I do not recommend it.
    One would think that Key and Peele can make a decent movie given their experience with sketches and all they needed to do was make a coherent narrative.
    This felt like a drawn out Key and Peele sketch rather than a series of sketches strung together.
    The later would have been more fun.

    Disappointing. Things are stylized which is good. Color grading isn't washed out.
    The soundtrack was unoriginal, and the action choreography was bizarre.

  explanation: >
    I went into this completely blind without knowing what it was about and came out of it satisfied despite it being a young adult novel.
    This reads very easily and is quite accessible without expecting the reader to understand much about the subject matter of transgender people.
    There are themes here that are relatable outside of the particular intended scope of the novel such as loneliness, depression, and identity which can be said to be universal concerns.
    With regards to the transgender side of things, the author acknowledges that certain aspects of the experience has been excluded to make it easier for readers to digest.
    This can hurt the impact, because details can make scenes more vivid.
    In addition to that, the main character does not appear to have a recognizable personality outside of her transgender experience which is unfortunate.
    Other characters can be quite cliche at times as well with common tropes making an appearance multiple times.
    That said, the happy ending, while unrealistic, does make for a satisfying story that can be used to fill in time without much regret.

    Despite this being fairly predictable, I thought it was an entertaining satire of modern martial arts.
    For a black comedy, this is not the best, but the way it made fun of parts of modern martial arts such as weird techniques, the belt system, and weird masculinity was fun.

  explanation: >
    I don't think I have ever seen a film about marketing or advertising.
    The closest thing I can think of is Argo or The Post, but those are completely different.
    The way in which this is filmed brings the viewer back to the time during the No campaign which helped to oust Pinochet in Chile and it feels as though you are watching history.
    In terms of contents, what makes this novel is the perspective given of the Chilean people, their politics, and the propaganda side of things.
    Everything else is played rather straight with a realistic portrayal of events and the style of filming used.
    It would have been nice to have been given a look at other aspects of the campaign against Pinochet, but as a film, its focus on the television campaign manages to create a compelling narrative.

  explanation: >
    What an experience.
    This is a film on the level of Akira or 2001: A Space Odyssey that transcends its own genre by even including non animated scenes of real people.
    This is sexual, grand, psychological, and philosophical to the point that the second half feels more German than Japanese.
    In the series, the final two episodes show internal struggles during the acquisition of human instrumentality and this film shows the external aspects of the process which makes it more grounded.
    While the reflection on life and suicide is not at the level of Camus' works in terms of explicit reasoning, this manages to create a deep analysis of the degeneration of ego, escapism, depression, individuality, collective conciousness, isolation, identity, and suicide.
    The theological aspects such as Jewish Kaballah are woven into the imagery and are quite thought provoking.
    In this, humans kill God, create God, become God, and reject God.
    I don't know much of what to make of the ending.
    It is not exactly sad or happy in an obvious way.
    It is rather a deconstruction of traditional story telling and is quite ambitious at that.
    I don't know if it is tragic, cathartic, or none of the above.
    There is closure in a vague sense and a demand for interpretation created by unapologetic ambiguity.
    In that sense, it is quite representative of life and reality.

    Prior to Manifold Garden, this was the non-euclidean game to play.
    I tried playing this once and failed to complete it about five years ago.
    The non-euclidean aspects are a bit underutilized with the majority of the mechanics being related to manipulation of blocks.
    Progression involves a high amount of exploration with quite a bit of trial and error which effectively trains the player in critical thinking.
    Unlike Manifold Garden, it does not seem as though there is a lore or backstory which makes it quite a bit more minimalistic in comparison.
    Soundtrack is primarily ambient.
    I wish there were some themes or purpose woven into the greater world of the game, but it is quite a unique puzzle game that challenges the player and teaches them in a way that causes growth in players who manage to practice a certain level of patience.

    I only watched the Death portion to prepare myself for End of Evangelion.
    Did this manage to jog my memory? Yes.
    Would I recommend this to others who have have not watched the series? Absolutely not.
    This made me remember that even though I did watch the series, I did not understand it at the time due to the fact that this story is like an iceberg with much of the context hidden under the surface.
    What this manages to do well, however, is give a decent overview of the psychological backgrounds of each of the main characters which is what seems to matter.
    Since Evangelion devolves/evolves from mecha and action based scifi to that of a dive into psychological despair and the flaws of humanity brought upon by free will, I doubt that my understanding will improve without outside reading.
    General plot is somewhat clarified here with with the inclusion of a string quartet composed of the main characters, and the general outline of the human instrumentality project is clearer to me now.
    I recommend also watching Alex Jones describe the plot of Evangelion to Joe Rogan to gain a high level understanding of the trajectory of the work.
    As a stand alone product, this is not good and it truly leverages the works that came before it to reach its high points.
    Good for the recap, but it fails to recreate the emotional rollercoaster and pacing of the series.
    On the plus side, if I decide to watch the series again, I can still watch it as though I am watching it for the first time due to this work only covering the most relevant angels/apostles.

  explanation: >
    It has been almost 10 years since I saw the Evangelion series and during that time, I had no idea that there was another ending or another series of films.
    In an attempt to recap without watching the entire series, I watched this to start.
    This transported me back to the 90's.
    Animation faithfully reproduces the scenery of Hakone, and it feels just like the original Evangelion in terms of animation and terrific sound design.
    Hideaki Anno's shot composition is truly some of the best in the industry and it translates well to live action as indicated in Shin Gojira.
    Music by Shirou Sagisu is iconic and recognizable as always, and the end credits song by Utada Hikaru was a surprise.
    In terms of story, character development is stunted in comparison to the original series, but the bibilical and psychological themes still come across due to the strong imagery.
    Since this is a recap of the first quarter of the series, this can be easily forgiven, but it would be concerning if this was the case for the rest of the rebuild tetralogy.
    The angels make for a great set of antagonists, and the way in which psychological abstractions are presented within biblical conditions seems to be unique to only a handful of works.
    Overall, quite impressive with pacing being its main problem.

    As a whole, this can be a hard read, but among the short stories presented are some of the best short stories I have ever read.
    These short stories are usually defined by a single unique idea that comes to light at a climax at the end of the story.
    This is like the literary equivalent of Escher or Dali.
    The stories begin with a dense introduction that expects readers to be cultured and well read.
    The book is split into two sections and the first section The Garden of Forking Paths, in my opinion, is far more interesting when compared to Artifices.
    There are aspects of this that I did not fully understand due to certain novels I have yet to read or a lack of familiarity with Argentina and its culture, but I feel that this is something I will definitely come back to in the future.

  explanation: >
    Continuation of 2017's Made in Abyss and just as brutal as the first season.
    This does not pull any punches.
    This could have been more successful as a series of episodes or a slightly longer movie with more content and faster pacing, but in its current state it is still quite good.
    In this film, we are shown a full conflict with Bondrewd who is one of the most interesting and unique villains I have seen recently and a great display of sociopathy within science.
    Animation is great and the music by Kevin Penkin is great as always.
    Since this is a film, the amount of world building which was a strength of the previous entry is not all there which is unfortunate.
    That said, this is a good-- maybe even great-- experience and while not quite at the level of the first season, it does not diminish the previous entry and maintains a level of consistency one might expect from the same director as Monster.

    This is a game that uses perspective as its primary mechanic to varying degrees of success.
    Small objects can become large, 3d can become 2d, and objects can be born within monochrome homogeneity.
    It is truly interesting, but due to the short nature of this game, it is not used to its full effect.
    In addition to this, there was an opportunity to do something more profound with regards to the story.
    This is a game about exploring dreams, but the background of a company using dreams for psychotherapy is not enough and I was hoping for more.
    It tries to be Portal, but unlike Portal, this is not humorous, so I am not sure what the developers intended here.
    Overall, this is a very interesting game that is too short.
    It should also be noted that due to the way this plays with perspective, this can force the player to do disorienting things which results in side effects such as nausea.

  explanation: >
    A supposedly futuristic game where you play a private investigator who is confined to her house.
    While the premise might make one imagine a hard boiled neo-noir, this is anything but.
    The game is comprised of multiple cases that look at different facets of the island of Farca and how those affect society.
    Gameplay is repetitive and while player choice may affect outcomes, choices and their consequences are not always clear.
    In additon to this, there are some mechanics such as a hacking AI, and what the character is doing away from her computer which are underutilized or misused.
    Overall, mediocre and probably not worth the time or money unless you are fine with wasting your time on something that is just okay.

  explanation: >
    A work that is the first in a trilogy.
    This has the feel of an older work from the 90's or early 2000's which is indicative of the source material it is based off of.
    The future presented in this is not quite as advanced as Blade Runner or other cyberpunk stories and it feels somewhat grounded despite some of the technological advancements coming across as a bit exaggerated.
    Action and visuals are stylized and feel like a cross between a manga and a western graphic novel.
    Pacing and plot structure needs work, but it should also be noted that this is only the first of 3.
    That said, based on what I have seen so far, this work does not stand on its own, and the world building is also lacking.
    What this does manage to do somewhat adequately was cover the effects of rape and abuse from a young age.
    How this will develop will determine the quality of the work as a whole, but on its own, this entry is mediocre.

    This entire film is a meme.
    It is quite enjoyable, but it is not Scorcese's best nor is it the best film about Wall Street.
    Acting and character interaction is the best aspect of this and DiCaprio nails it. 
    Plot structure literally feels like a straight line with everything being relatively predictable.
    That said, it is very fun and it never gets boring and the cameo by Jordan Belfort was a nice touch.

    A short game which utilizes a time loop mechanic.
    Unlike Outer Wilds, this utilizes interaction with environments and characters to change possible outcomes.
    The twists and turns themselves are not the best, but it was entertaining while it lasted.
    Voice acting by James McAvoy, Daisy Ridley, and Willem Dafoe was well done.
    The endings were quite disappointing and the payoff was somewhat underwhelming.
    There is some sort of deeper psychological underpinning, but it is not clearly elaborated upon which weakens the psychological subtexts.

  explanation: >
    A self aware film that is probably quite divisive in nature with regards to its qualities.
    This is similar to Hiroyuki Imaishi's other works in that it is extremely stylized.
    In the case of this work, the art style is like the works of Genndy Tartakovsky on steroids.
    The animation is more reminiscent of western 2d animation than Japanese animation in that sense.
    Story is threadbare with the writers literally saying that they are making things up as they go along and declaring a deus ex machina within what I assume is the third act.
    This is a film that requires a high suspension of disbelief and an ability to keep up with its spastic pacing.
    That said, for fans of studio Trigger, this is a highly indulgent film that offers a lot of self referential nods to previous works by the studio that are in my opinion far superior.

    Lex Fridman's commentary on the Tesla AI Day is actually far more insightful than that of journalists due to the way in which he does into detail regarding the neural architecture and machine learning pipeline.

  explanation: >
    Said to be one of the greatest movies ever made.
    While I would not necessarily place it on the same level as Citizen Kane or Vertigo, I do agree that it is quite close.
    This is supposedly a film about a bicycle, but there is much more going on beneath the surface.
    At the same time, this is a film about postwar Italian society, relationship between father and son, and adversity.
    There are no special effects, camera movement is simple but effective, and we can only depend on the acting of those involved to sell the story.
    The way in which it is structured is quite well done-- particularly with the ending of the film.

    Simple and innovative.
    A great work that moves the medium forward.
    This game uses a webcam to detect blinks and the blinking of the player controls the progression of the game.
    The story is simple, but handled terrifically and touches upon the topic of life, meaning, and mortality.
    It has similarities to That Dragon, Cancer, but this is less tedious, more to the point, and more effective.
    The score is also well done.
    Gameplay is simple, but the use of blinks seems to have some sort of psychological effect when playing the game that affects the player in a greater manner than standard gameplay.
    There are areas where there is a challenge of not blinking which is something that I have never trained which can be challenging for some players.
    I believe that similar mechanics that utilize webcameras and computer vision to do interesting things have a lot of promise for the future of the medium.

    This has quite a bit of acclaim due to its popularity as a classic Christmas movie, and while I think it is a good film, I also cannot understand how people miss some of the obvious flaws.
    Some of the editing is jerky.
    James Stewart plays James Stewart like he does in all of his movies.
    Cinematography is above average.
    Potter who stole money at the end of the film gets away with his crime.

  explanation: >
    Wolfgang Petersen can be hit or miss, but this is a definite hit.
    Given the long runtime of this film, I had to split this up over multiple days which is probably the preferred method of viewing.
    This film feels like something that was made in the 70's with its general pacing, cinematography, and special effects which is very welcome.
    The film ranges from tedious to a rollercoaster of emotions, but it never gets boring.
    The set design makes it feel like they used an actual submarine and at times I wondered if they did.
    Since this was made before the use of widespread CGI, everything is practical which means that everything looks real.
    The German perspective combined with the claustrophobic nature of the U-Boat provide a distinctive feel that is only ever matched in part by other films.
    Overall, a triumph with a somewhat surprising ending.

  explanation: >
    I enjoyed the original Mirror's Edge, so I was looking forward to this as well.
    The decision to replace handcrafted linear levels partially with an open world was questionable, but also welcome in that it offers something to do outside of the story.
    The story's quality is questionable as well due to a substandard method of delivery and lack of character development and interactions.
    When compared to Mirror's Edge, the parkour movements felt as polished, but the combat aspects are just as weak and should have been removed.
    The setting and aesthetic is beautiful and should have been turned up to 11.
    Music and score by Solar Fields is great.
    I felt that writing as well as design of levels and the world were the primary problems, and fixing these would partially improve the game.
    An open world is wasted if it is not populated with interesting things to do which is one of the main failings of this game.
    Collectibles are nice, but have no meaning beyond gaining experience to unlock skills. Outside of that, there is no character customization.

  explanation: >
    Hypnotizing and broad in terms of the topics it explores.
    There are themes of intellectualism, love, journalism, family and many others.
    This film shows a naive version of the way things are and then deconstructs those things to show that everything is worse than it actually is.
    This is a film about images, and Federico Fellini moves cameras over scenes in deliberate fashion.
    Characters are distinctive and easy to identify with almost half of the characters being of non-Italian origin which gives this a cosmopolitan feel.
    I enjoyed this more than 8½, but I am unsure of which is the better film.
    That said, this is undoubtedly a great film and solidifies my opinion of Fellini as one of the best Italian directors.

    I don't have much to say about this one.
    It is similar to Tom Sawyer, but has more going on in my opinion.
    The humor is a bit dated, but at times it can still be used to make statements about society.
    Controversy regarding this work is overblown when considering the time and location in which the story takes place.
    Good, but when compared to other great novels of the time, this does not compare.

    There have been many films about world war II, but there are fewer films about the GDR and Weimar republic which tend to be overshadowed by the war.
    This film covers the GDR and domestic surveillance and it is a home run of a film in terms of all aspects.
    This is moving, well paced, a film over two hours that is never boring.
    It is hard to believe that this is a directorial debut.
    The way in which a Stasi officer is affected by the people under his surveillance was well handled and convincing and it managed to show character development as well as the state of the GDR during the time.
    Overall, an outstanding film that is one of the best to come out of the German film industry and it is unfortunate that Ulrich Mühe passed away shortly after this film.

    This reminded me of Hugo in its adoration for film, but I consider this to be better.
    This starts off slowly, but it builds over time and ends quite well.
    The Italian used here is sometimes Sicillian, so it is not the easiest to understand.
    This movie has no violence, no special effects, no complex plot, only passion for film and the way its characters use it to live their lives.
    Cinematography is great, and it manages to capture the allure of an Italian town and the feel of an older theatre quite well.
    Attention to detail regarding projection adds to the general feel of the film.
    This has sentimental value, and it manages to move through its story in an indulgent and deliberate manner without lagging.

    With this, I have completed the last decent Halo game developed by Bungie and conclude my interest in the series.
    This is an improvement upon Halo 3 in terms of presentation of story and gameplay despite it being a prequel that is missing many of the main characters from the previous games.
    Characterization and development is lacking in comparison to previous games due to a minimalist touch which is one of the main drawbacks, but gameplay, pacing, and technical aspects are quite improved.
    The decision to have players play as a Spartan who is not Master Chief was interesting and changed the way players would approach the game.

    Roberto Benigni, for better or worse, is what makes this film.
    He was the main character, the director, and one of th writers and his personality is what drives the primary message of optimism, gratitude and beauty.
    This man brings an energy to the screen that is not matched by many and makes this film a unique experience.
    The backdrop of the holocaust brings about some mixed effects that may be a point of division for many since it is not primary focus, but rather a way in which to contextualize the aforementioned themes.
    As a result, realism and brutality of the event may not be quite at the level one might expect and the film may be conflicting in nature to some.
    This is definitely the case when compared with a film like Schindler's List which I consider to be the superior film despite it being completely different in terms of focus.
    That said, I thought the Oscar wins were well deserved and that this was an unapologetically Italian film that wears its heart on its sleeve and manages to make an impact.

    Solid conclusion that has flaws, but ultimately does what it sets out to do.
    Gameplay is very much the same as previous entries with this feeling like a continuation of other games with improved graphics.
    Vehicle handling feels worse for some reason, however.
    Story picks up where the previous game left off, but I felt as though it was underdeveloped and could have offered a larger amount of world building and character interactions as fanservice at the very least.
    More cutscenes and more dialogue could easily fix some of the problems that I had.
    Overall, I am glad that I was able to finish the trilogy and see the conclusion to its end.
    Music is great and iconic as always.
    Although I felt that it could have been a grander ending with greater scale, it was enjoyable and had a feel similar to action movies from the 80's like Aliens.

    Smartly written, funny and insightful.
    In this, Dustin Hoffman plays and actor who pretends to be a woman so that he could gain a female part in a soap opera.
    As the story progresses, his relationships with other characters becomes strained and affected by his choices.
    There is a statement on society, acting, and gender roles which may have been ahead of its time, or perhaps a response to second wave feminism.

    Quite bad.
    I had no idea why anything was happening.
    The previous Wonder Woman movie took the setting of World War 1 into account and played upon serious themes to create compelling arcs and characters.
    This film felt like a caricature where the setting of 1984 was more of a novelty and all the development from the previous film was thrown out the window.
    It is for this reason why this felt like 2.5 hours wasted.
    What this goes to show is that bad writing and narrative can waste a large budget and experienced actors.
    There was a Linda Carter cameo which also seemed hamfisted and should have been handled far better.
    After seeing Zack Snyder's Justice League, this felt like a definite step backwards because of bad writing and terrible directing.

    A fun and casual viewing that does not try to do too much.
    The story is not ground breaking, but it presents a standard action story with a self aware sense of humor.
    Choreography is not ground breaking either, but it was entertaining and the fast editing was not fast enough to make things feel incoherent which was a plus.

    As a Zhang Yimou film, the first question many may have is whether this is historically accurate, and this takes fewer liberties than other Zhang Yimou films.
    The story is told in a very simple manner and is easy to follow.
    Visuals are the main attraction and are handled extremely well where many frames are quite memorable.
    The use of color in particular is quite striking.
    The location does not change and the main visual changes are in seasons and colors, but for some reason this manages to stay interesting through its runtime.
    In addition to that, the story is not a happy one.
    As a result, it has more of an effect of haunting the viewer after completion.

    As a game, this is disappointing.
    As a story, this is promising and very interesting.
    Gameplay is boring. The open world structure of the previous game has been made more linear which takes away from much of the appeal of the previous game.
    This game introduces time travel, eternal recurrence, and has an arc where the main character of Raziel sees the completion of his arc as a tragic hero in the Shakespearean sense.
    Lore is further refined and conversations on free will, good and evil, and false dichotomies continue in this work as well.
    I don't know if it is worth playing, but the story is interesting enough that at least reading up on it is worth it despite the cliffhanger.

    It appears that many of the greatest films have some sort of meta aspect to it.
    In the case of this film, this is a Hollywood film that criticizes Hollywood.
    In addition to that, it crosses across multiple genres which differentiates it from the others Billy Wilder films such as Some Like it Hot.
    At times it is a comedy, sometimes a drama, and once in a while, a horror film.
    Similar to Singing in the Rain, it also offers commentary on the move from silent films to talkies and features cameos by some famous figures such as Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton.
    Acting in this is interesting in that side characters had better performances than the main ones with the exception of Gloria Swanson who stole the show.
    Despite this being more than 70 years old, it is still engaging and should be required viewing.

  explanation: >
    In this work, Nietzsche uses a more traditional style of writing without a narrative like Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
    This covers morality, Christianity, free will, and deconstructs some of the works of previous philosophers while building his own thoughts upon the base they provide.
    The organization of this book is in similar form to Thus Spoke Zarathustra in that topics are not covered in logical steps and are instead covered in thematic steps which is quite unconventional.
    I think to understand this, emotion plays a role, so mileage will vary. I personally found Thus Spoke Zarathustra more useful.
    Since this covers similar topics, the former may be a better use of time.
    One aspect I did find useful was Nietzsche's explanation of the will to power.

    This has quite a similar feel to Kimi no Na wa.
    With regards to story, it is somewhat similar in quality, but on a technical level, it feels as though it is far superior.
    This showcases unbelievably detailed animation that is bordering on photorealism at times which is quite impressive, because I thought it was originally impossible for Makoto Shinkai to outdo himself given high levels of detail in his previous films.
    This, combined with its highly realistic depiction of Tokyo makes it very memorable.
    The focus on weather and heavy rainfall references the impact of global warming during the rainy season.
    The third act was weaker than the rest of the film, but it was enjoyable throughout.
    Although I think Kimi no Na wa was a better film, but I think I enjoyed this more due to the nostalgia it brought for me.
    Crossovers and cameos of characters from Shinkai's previous film were appreciated as well.

    Surprisingly deep lore and philosophical musings make this stand out among other entries during the time it came out.
    Questions regarding life, death, free will and good and evil make it directly related to the works of Nietzsche and maybe Dante.
    Gameplay can be repetitive, but approaches to puzzles are reminiscent of Zelda games at times.
    Given the time in which this came out, it can also feel clunky at times.
    Finishing this game can be quite difficult due to aged graphics and obscure solutions that may require a guide to be solved.
    Voice work was handled well and definitely was great considering the time of release.
    It's age holds it back, but its story makes it unique.
    It is unfortunate that it ends in a cliffhanger which requires players to experience the sequel as well.

    A Japanese version of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
    Mifune Toshirou plays the main character as is typical in many of Kurosawa's other works.
    Like many Shakespearean plays, the plot devices are the same, but this lacks the wordplay and prose for obvious reasons.
    Instead, it replaces that with cultural fixtures and strong acting.
    Since this is a work by Kurosawa, camerawork and shots are great as always.
    In addition to this, it offers something different by bringing attention to the setting as well.
    A great film, but there are better among Kurosawa's body of work.

  explanation: >
    This is a work of genius that should be considered as art.
    The utilization of simple geometry to create infinite environments that draw from a variety of styles of architecture from classical Greek to Japanese is handled extremely well.
    Use of infinite environments lead to scenes of a scale that I have never before seen in a game and give birth to fractal patterns that mimic mandala style configurations which complements eastern architectural styles in the game.
    The dynamic sound system makes it so that your actions can directly affect the music played based on the areas you are in, and Laryssa Okada's score leaves a strong impression.
    Similar to Inception, this takes M.C. Escher based ideas to the next level.
    It is clear that an understanding of physics, architecture, eastern styles of spirituality, and technical expertise was needed to develop this game.
    When taken at face value, this is a puzzle game, but in my experience, the appeal of this lies within the environments the player explores as they make their way through the game.
    It feels as though one is traveling through a stripped down manifestation of human civilization when it is freed from space, time, color, and the people that built it.
    Environments are simple in nature, but easily evoke emotions that are congruent with standing on top of a mountain, within a large temple, or in an empty metropolis.
    I have had dreams like what I saw here, but it is truly liberating to be able to explore such environments of my own free will.

  explanation: >
    The Song of Achilles builds upon the story in the Iliad and manages to add to the story in a way that is similar to The Historian.
    For those who are familiar with the Iliad, the general sequence of events does not come as a surprise, so what is impressive about this work is the way in which it manages to keep the familiar story fresh.
    In the case of this work, a greater focus is given to the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus which has not been covered all that well in the past.
    This work offers a unique perspective in that it is centered on Patroclus and his experiences.
    This dynamic is similar in nature to the dynamic seen in My Fair Concubine.
    The author makes a point in bringing the emotional ties between characters as a center focus which can be easily lost within the poetic text of the Iliad.
    This makes this work innovative and novel.

    Probably my favorite Tim Burton film.
    This manages to excel in terms of its ability to portray isolation and ostracism while also having a sense of humor.
    Johnny Depp handles the role of Edward very well despite not speaking all that often in the film.
    His ability to physically depict emotion is reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin.
    In terms of visuals, the setting is a cross between fairy tale, and a caricature of suburbia.
    Special effects are handled well.
    The combination of its different aspects increases the absurdity of the whole thing, but does not take away from the emotional underpinnings of the film.

    Violent, exaggerated, and hyperreal with highly detailed artwork that easily stands the test of time.
    In terms of story, it is in the vein of Blade Runner, but due to it being quite short, nothing of significance could be said to have been accomplished with its narrative.

    I don't usually watch or read things based on the premise alone, but this was an exception.
    From a critical angle, this is not particularly remarkable, but the premise of autism gives it some interesting situations.
    The struggle of participating in social and educational situations with the condition of autism can be quite educational at times.
    Similarly, the inclusion of LGBT themes were not particularly forced.
    Outside of that, the show is filled with tropes that are standard in family dramas and as a result, I cannot say that this is comparable to many of the great works I have previously watched, but this was entertaining.

    A very strange film that, when taken at face value, does not seem all that strange despite the premise.

    Camera work is unconventional, the actor who plays Kaspar Hauser was in his 40's at the time and had no acting experience.
    Similarly, the narrative structure is bizarre.
    This film does not try to make any statements regarding Kaspar Hauser and whether he is a fraud or not.

  explanation: >
    This is the first work of postmodernism that I have read and it signifies a shift towards more societal concerns within philosophical works.
    In this, the primary argument is that everything within our reality has become abstracted through societal and cultural constructs to become hyperreal to the point where everything no longer represents reality.
    This is quite relevant to our world today if one simply looks at social media, modern education, or financial institutions.
    With regards to the place of this work within the larger tapestry of philosophy, Baudrillard makes references to nihilism which I believe is correctly identified as the area that his work is a corollary of.
    While past philosophers may question existence itself, in the case of Baudrillard, even if what we perceive exists, such existence is invalidated due to the way in which increasing levels of abstraction are utilized.
    Interestingly enough, there are aspects of this work that consist of simulacra, making me wonder whether how valid the conclusions found here truly are at times.
    I am curious to see what Baudrillard would think of dataism as well as whether absurdist philosophy can complement his works.
    I am also curious to see what solutions exist as a possible resolution to the problems defined.

    In addition to this, it used Bushido principles in a somewhat misguided way, but somehow it managed to work.
    The color grading is saturated and dark and complments the characters and themes very well.

  explanation: >
    This 6 hour long album is a deep dive into a recreation of the first 6 stages of dementia and is quite ambitious in nature.
    I listened to each stage on a separate day and the increasing levels of modulation and modification of the original tracks in the first stage along with the passage of time successfully made it more and more difficult to tell what the original samples were.
    The more interesting progressions begin to occur from the 3rd to 6th stages where music can be disorienting and the semblance of a time signature, key or any other conventions are becomming increasingly difficult to determine due to the aleotoric nature of the music.
    In my opinion, instances of neural retrogenesis in stage 5 as well as terminal lucidity within stage 6 were probably the most interesting.
    What is quite clear is that by modifying the music, the sense of time becomes lost along with the identity of the work which translates well to the parallel of dementia, but it should be noted that other forms of neural degeneration can have similar effects.
    I recommend listening to this with no visual or other sensory simulation to increase the effects.
    The Caretaker's work has shown a deep understanding of music production, dementia, and simply a large amount of research that managed to successfully capture some of the existential concerns inherent in dementia.

    This is a great film that felt very real.
    The way in which it depicted events and places was not only poetic, but also very easy to relate to.
    Although this is on the surface about being black and being gay, it is more about understanding one's identity and growing up in hard conditions.
    This shows the flaws in all people, and at the same time, there are instances that offer moments of lucidity.
    The film is split into 3 moments in time, and all actors of all ages delivered spectacularly for their roles.

    I remember when this was a highly rated and ambitious mobile game.
    That said, many years have passed since the first episode was released for mobile, and the novelty is not quite the same on another platform.
    Story is cryptic, but not in a good way.
    It is similar to many dystopian stories, but the way in which information is presented indirectly makes it difficult to make out a coherent story at times.
    Topics regarding clones used as hard drives by storing information within DNA does not make logistical sense for anyone who is familiar with DNA based computers.
    Characters are supported by a good voice cast, but the writing is lacking.
    Gameplay is reminiscent of metal gear solid, but has a twist where you don't play the protagonist and instead are forced to watch through cameras in a manner that is similar to Observation.

  explanation: >
    I had some prior experience with Goethe due to my familiarity with his theory of colors, but I have only just now began exploring what is considered his greatest work.
    I did not like part 1 of Faust. It felt far too similar to The Picture of Dorian Gray, and the conversations between Faust and Mephistopheles were probably the only thing about the first part that I found to be interesting.
    It should also be noted that I was not a fan of many works of Gothic literature which is also why I most likely did not enjoy part 1 despite it being a more personal experience for doctor Faust and his pursuit for knowledge and purpose.
    The second part seems to aim higher and become far more ambitious with a more classical approach to the plot with elements of Greek literature and mythology making an appearance.
    It is this part where I began to see the value of the work and why it was considered one of the best works of German literature.
    That said, it is hard to determine how well this can translate to the stage by simply reading it, because there are parts of this work that can get quite abstract at times.
    It should be noted that there are instances of humor in this work to even things out.
    In addition to this, there are figures who make an appearance who are not from Greek mythology or Christianity who I can only assume are from a German mythos.
    Overall, I don't know what to make of it as a whole, but I can see tremendous value in certain parts of this work.

    Paul Verhoeven generally had a downward trend in the quality of his films over time, but this one is one of the better ones despite it being quite flawed.
    This is unique in that it has a female perspective of the second world war from the Dutch side, but it is also quite indulgent and hits some of the same notes as Soldaat van Oranje which makes it feel derivative in many ways.
    There are aspects of this that have been handled better by Paul Verhoeven's previous works, the works of Steven Speilberg, and many other films that have been released prior to this one.
    The positives lie within the story and the acting, but if there was a point to this film or primary message, it is a bit unclear.
    The organization of events, pacing, and transitions are quite messy which is what prevents it from being on the level of films by the aforementioned directors.
    The depiction of postwar attrocities was well done, but do suffer from the flaws previously mentioned.
    As far as Dutch films are concerned, this seems to be one of the better ones, but it should be noted that the film output of the Netherlands does not quite compare with the film industries of other larger countries which means that there is not much competition domestically.
    Overall, good but lacking.

    For a Dutch film, this felt more like a French film due to that being the primary language spoken.
    In terms of genre, I could not figure out if this was a thriller, a horror film, or a psychological film and it is similar to Psycho in that sense.
    In terms of suspense, this is Hitchcockian in that it shows who committed the crime from the very beginning and instead of trying to determine who did it, we try to understand why and how.
    The sociopathic tendencies made the main antagonist almost relatable at times due to the smartly written script.
    We care less about what happened and try instead to understand what motivates the characters and that is what makes this film engaging and great.

    A greatly constructed analysis of the human condition based on a novel by Abe Koubou.
    This is well shot and the focus on sand as a source of suffering is very new to me.
    I have seen humanity's fight with the sea, with the frigid cold, and the heat, but never sand, and that made this feel very different from many other films.
    The premise is quite simple where one much dig sand out of a pit that is continuously filling with sand everyday.
    This has been stated to have some similarity to The Myth of Sisyphus, but the enjoyment of the moment as is stated in absurdism is very limited in this context and is only ever indicated towards the end of the film.
    This seems to be its own original study in eternal labor and that makes it a film to be studied.

    This game and its DLC are quite basic in its execution, but ambitious in concept.

    It tries to tackle and question things such as free will, consciousness and truth within the context of a god.
    Gameplay is composed of exploring a world composed of puzzles which makes it similar to The Witness.
    The puzzles themselves involve exploration of 3d space and taking advantage of simple mechanics that can be used to manipulate the environment like Portal.
    Puzzles themselves are quite challenging and build upon themselves quite effectively.

  explanation: >
    So, this is apparently related to the horse that caused Nietzsche to have a mental breakdown in the city of Turin.
    That said, the connection is not all that clear because we never see the aforementioned scene and this seems closer to something like Eraserhead with its feelings of emptiness.
    This is a slow film that breaks conventions in film and simply follows a simple life of endless hardship and boredom.
    Béla Tarr provides a genius film that focuses on the minutia of a simple and hard life that consists of eating boiled potatoes and dealing with an endless storm that snuffs out hope in the middle of a degenerating society that we never see in full.
    The film plays with light, subject and movement with perfect cinematography and the way in which light is snuffed out towards the end makes it truly unique and audacious.

    I enjoyed this very much and found it to either match or exceed the previous season's performance.
    The appeal and flaws of the previous season remains and new inventions of human civilization are leveraged as plot devices.
    In this season, steam power, gun powder, nitroglycerin, vacuum tubes, hydroelectrically powered devices, refrigeration, and cellular communication make an appearance this time in anachronistic fashion.

  explanation: >
    I like to think of this as a general explanation of existentialism that is intended as a type of primer while also making a few personal statements on the matter.
    Basically, the partially novel part of this work is that Sartre states that life is meaningless unless you give it meaning and that life is what you make of it.
    There are certain things that are out of our control, but what is within our control are our own actions.
    This is why existentialism can be considered to be humanism.
    This is what I consider to be of interest, but I have also seen this in other works as tangential topics, so this did not come as a large surprise.

  explanation: >
    It is my opinion that the essay format is far more effective for philosophical ponderings and such was the case for this essay.
    In the case of Peter Wessel's work, he states that the human intellect is overdeveloped for the purpose of sustaining a life.
    Zapffe talks about anchoring such as the choosing of a goal which is a way to temporarily forget about the abject meaninglessness of reality.
    In that sense, many of the things society advocates, be it love, a profession, or family, are more of distractions to delude oneself into thinking that life has greater meaning if it has meaning at all.
    Quite well done for its short length with the only criticism being that it lacks empirical backing with regards to human emotion.
    One thing I notice in many of the nihilistic works I have come across is that the majority seem to depend on certain concepts as axioms that may not even exist such as meaning, cause and effect, and time.
    In that sense, they don't go as far as they can with regards to pushing the philosophy to its absolute limit.

  explanation: >
    The version I read contained sufferings of the world, emptiness of existence and vanity of existence.
    This is a comprehensive overview of suffering and misery and I feel as though it should be a required prerequisite prior to reading any Buddhist texts or Nietzsche.
    Schopenhauer is the most realistic philosopher I have had the pleasure of reading that correctly identifies pain and suffering as a primary driver of human existence which is an intermediary step in a larger process.
    He also acts as a primer for ascetic practices and in many ways retreads the same ground as mystics thousands of years prior, but unlike those individuals, Schopenhauer manages to outline his arguments eloquently.
    Although Schopenhauer does not recommend ascetism, he does seem to follow a more Epicurean prescription whereby pain is minimized during life.
    Whether such approaches are truly successful are questionable, but since On the Suffering of the World focuses on the suffering rather than the potential cure, Schopenhauer manages to sidestep the problem of explaining the answer to suffering within this work at least.

    This is a short analysis of faith through the story of Abraham.
    There is a contemplation of the anxiety or fear Abraham had prior to his attempted sacrifice of Isaac and he then extrapolates this to human life in general.
    This is supposed to be an answer to Hegel's work, but since I did not read Hegel's work because I am not a masochist or particularly interested in Christian theology at the moment, this was not quite as rewarding as other works.
    In many cases, the concepts provided here felt quite basic and self-explanatory with many of the lessons in ethics and life seeming to be a repeat of other, more modern, works that I have read previously except those works did not have theological aspects found in this work.

  explanation: >
    This is probably the most difficult philosophical work I have read and it often reads more like a mathematics textbook rather than a work of philosophy.
    Those with prior mathematical knowledge of predicate logic and probability theory may already find some of the concepts such as a priori and a posteriori as well as syllogisms, paralogisms, tautologies, and antimonies to be familiar.
    This work introduces concepts such as transcendental idealism, schematisms, Kantian manifolds and noumenons which are a staple of Kantian philosophy and builds upon those concepts with succeeding complexity to approach many areas of study.
    It builds off of the work of previous philosophers such as Hume, Leibniz, and Descartes.
    Kant's work can be simply summarized as a critique and analysis of empirical thought, science, and intuitions due to the limitation of human perception.
    Kant analyzes what makes a concept, what is needed for something to be recognized as a thing or object.
    This is a work that is quite significant because it calls into question the existence of time, space, cause and effect, what is required to prove an omniscient and omnipotent creator, as well as how our understanding may truly be a description of our perception rather than our reality.
    This later aspect is why Kant considers this work to be his epistemological Copernican revolution.

  explanation: > 
    An overview of entropy presented in collaboration with Sean Carroll.
    I don't like the presentation style of Sean Carroll, but since this is only a 15 minute playlist, I consider it to be acceptable.
    This covers concepts like complexity, cause and effect, and the use of entropy to deduct a meaning of life.
    While this does take initial steps towards using entropy to answer philosophical questions, the lack of an explanation with regards to how entropy affects perceptions of utility, morals, and meaning as well, whether time exists or not, as well as physical manifestations of the central value theorem made this somewhat disappointing.
    Simply put, a Kantian perspective on the matter can be used to easily poke holes in what was presented which is why additional steps must be taken to fill in the holes offered by this playlist.
    Next steps would include learning information theory and chaos theory.

    The final film in a long series of films to conclude a continuity that was started by The Flashpoint Paradox 7 years prior.
    This is a surprisingly good film because it manages to sidestep problems like character development by simply standing on top of the previous works to provide something that is coherent and satisfying.
    With regards to the story, it is not particularly novel and it is predictable to a point, but the way in which heroes that were the main characters of previous installments were dropping like flies gave it some weight.

    A continuation of the story in The Death of Superman.
    This acts as a setup for a final battle with Darkseid and has many parallels with the Snyder cut of Justice League in terms of setup.

    This is a film that is very Japanese.
    It feels old, new and timeless all at the same time.
    The setting is that of traditional family relations that center around aging parents.
    Camera work is higly minimal with movement being entirely absent in most scenes which is apparently unique to Yasujiro Ozu's films.
    The story is quite standard, but it ends up offering a more profound commentary on human relations and society during the time in which the story took place which was years right after World War II.
    From a historical perspective, this can be educational, because Tokyo back in the 50's is completely different from Tokyo today.
    When compared with other great Japanese films like Ikiru for example, this does share a number of similarities, but in comparison, this is far slower in pacing which makes it different from the Kurosawa films.

    The game has interesting aspects to it such as remote control of probes in zero-g, an equivalent to 2001's monolith in the form of a pentagon, transhumanism, and the use of a many worlds interpretation to add an interesting dimension to the flow of the story.

    While I prefer Sergio Leone's works, this is a great stylistic western that is just as iconic as Leone's works.
    The use of anti-heroes as the main characters made this quite unique where all of the characters had some sort of flaw.
    This is a violent movie during a time in which violence was not quite as common within film and the way in which it was unapologetic about was quite interesting.
    Cinematography is great with the way in which the camera pans over landscapes and scenes that are taken out of the early 1900's.

  explanation: >
    Due to the time in which this was published as well as Schmitt's role in the Nazi party, his works have only recently been given serious treatment from the academic community.
    Similar to The Allegory of the Cave, while this is a work in political theory, I found the existential implications far more fascinating.
    Schmitt deconstructs politics and frames it as a distinction between friend and enemy similar to how economics is a distinction between utility and valueless constructs.
    It also highlights the downsides of liberalism by framing it as a naive oversimplification that ignores human nature.
    The most important themes that I found to be interesting were that of proper identification of friend and enemy, that the lack of an enemy will result in friends becoming enemies, that reality is inherently hostile, and that the pressure of survival is a key part of human nature.
    This not only tries to touch upon a key aspect of human nature, but also manages to describe accurately the policies of many modern governments today.
    In particular, I found this to be a useful tool to analyze the United States' military industrial complex and its purpose.
    Schmitt is also one of the only individuals of his time that considers the nature of the political to change based on technology and he seems to get close, but never reaches the concept of countries and nations becoming obsolete.

    This has high production value, and the animation work is well done.
    The story is as described in the light novel for beter and for worse, so there is not much to be said there other than that this manages to innovate in the isekai genre with its detailed lore, but is weaker with some of its character flaws which fall into standard tropes within the medium.

  explanation: >
    An introduction and argument towards the acceptance of absurdism.
    Absurdism in this case refers to that which is beyond the realms of rationality.
    Camus takes a journey through the history of philosophy before finally arriving at his using of Sisyphus to make the point that a life of torment is that of happiness due to the struggle involved.
    Camus states that absurdism is a step beyond nihilism where absurdity is close in meaning to meaninglessness.
    Accepting this meaninglessness is what Camus states is the antithesis of physical or philosophical suicide which is a statement of an inability to accept the the absurd nature of our reality.
    Instead Camus states that an act of metaphysical rebellion against death is a way to optimize life.
    This last statement is what makes this work valueable an an interesting area of study as it directly contradicts the works of many notable philosophers.

    I enjoyed this, but this is a flawed work.
    For a game that is linear and consists of cutscenes, I am surprised at how computationally heavy it was for some strange reason.
    In terms of story, I consider it to be quite well handled with pacing being the best strength.
    In the story here, it retreads familiar ground as The Dark Knight, but it focuses more on Bruce Wayne and functions like an origin story that manages to do something other origin stories have not.
    In that sense, the more story based focus which is a centerpiece of many Telltale games allows for greater exploration of inner motivations which was quite good.
    The main problems here is that of the gameplay which is quite problematic due to the fact that this is a game first and foremost.
    Mechanics involve quicktime events, simplistic puzzles, and choices that do not truly affect the story all that significantly.
    Compared to other Telltale games like The Wolf Among Us or Borderlands, I consider this to be inferior, but I did enjoy it at least.

  explanation: >
    Ambitious, contradictory, and perhaps timeless.
    This is a work that tries to do many things and retreads familiar ground, but takes a more modern approach with interesting results.
    At face value, this feels like a combination of themes that can be seen within Christianity and Buddhism, but in many cases, this is a rejection of Christrian themes.
    Nietzsche focuses on reaching the state of the overman where one transcends their humanity to become something greater which is similar to that of enlightenment in Buddhism.
    Similar to Buddhism, Nietzsche recognizes the suffering in the world and the value in overcoming.
    That said, Nietzsche takes a more beligerent approach that values laughter in place of the eightfold path.
    There is also a strange focus on the negative aspects of women which did not age well.
    The way in which it presents its ideas is with a narrative structure which I found to be quite effective, but the journey that Zarathustra or Zoroaster takes seems quite meandering and preachy.
    This is why, although I have a positive opinion of the work with regards to the individual commentaries that it makes, I am mixed regarding the larger overarching theme.
    In that sense, it truly is a book for everyone and a book for no one.

    Average and unremarkable.
    Although this focuses mainly on the Doomsday fight with Superman, there is limited character development, and the world does not feel fleshed out.
    Pacing is also inconsistent.
    The only reason to watch this is to watch the sequels.

    A fun ride that is very much in the spirit of other action films during the time like The Magnificent Seven.
    All characters are memorable, all actors play their parts well, and the way in which the escape from the Nazi prison camp was paced kept it engaging throughout.
    The writers made a smart decision by not only showing the escape, but also the aftermath in the final act which brings the story to a larger more cosmopolitan scale.
    This is also old enough that the movie actually has a score where the theme is memorable which is quite rare nowadays.
    This is a classic that should be required viewing.

    This shares many similarities to Kimetsu no Yaiba, but I enjoyed this far more, because it seemed to cater more to my interests.
    Stylistically, it felt modern, but it also had similarities in style to older shounen stories like Bleach, and Hunter x Hunter.
    Unlike those previous entries, this had extremely high quality animation that made it feel like Fate/Zero at times.
    In the case of this work, the animation is so well done that the episodic format of the story can work against its best aspects at times and drag down the pacing from time to time.
    Sound design is also great with the modern score not taking away from the other aspects of the work.
    With regards to the story, it is standard and not particularly ambitious, but the use of curses that are generated by the accumulation of negative human emotions allows for commentary on human nature to be made.
    That said, it does not get as philosophical as it can be, but if taken purely at face value, it makes for an enjoyable ride.

  explanation: >
    This is an anti-war novel that inspired a Metallica song as well as lead to the creation of a film in the 1970's.
    Despite these other mediums being considered, I feel that only a novel can truly emulate the sensory deprivation and isolation described in the novel.
    The novel is told entirely from the perspective of Joe Bonham who cannot see, hear, smell, or taste due to injuries that took away his major senses, his limbs, his face, and his ability to speak.
    This was a smart move on Trumbo's part because it creates an element of suspense and maintains a certain level of mystery that is seen throughout the novel.
    While the focus of this novel is regarding the implications of war, I was more fascinated with some of the philosophical aspects of it.
    Specifically, I was quite interested in the egocentric predicament and the basis of reasoning which I will explore in the near future when I read one of Immanuel Kant's works.
    Overall, this is one of the better novels that I have read recently and it has a visceral impact that very few novels have.

    Fast paced, sharply edited, and well acted.
    There were no weak links in this movie about real estate salesmen.
    The story is simple, and there are no bells or whistles, just pure acting and writing that keeps you engaged from beginning to end with its intense dialogue.
    From the moment Alec Baldwin opened his mouth to the end, it was a film that never stopped.
    Jack Lemmon's performance in particular showcased a range of motions from desperation to triumph.
    While it does not take full advantage of the medium of film, it works as a great drama.

  explanation: >
    Quite good albeit somewhat unrealistic story of love that lasts for decades.
    It's first half was strong with the second half being a bit weaker.
    In terms of narrative trajectories, this felt like a cross between Before Sunrise and Lost in Translation, but when compared to the two, this felt quite a bit more minimalistic.
    The largest difference is that this is less philosophical, involves less talking, and more retrospection where all characters have more of a backstory.
    This is quite accessible, slow, and very well shot with cinematography and music being one of its better aspects.
    Music is simple but effective, and dialogue is also straightforward.
    The use of flashbacks in some films is not handled very well in terms of pacing, but in this film, it works.
    There are aspects of this film that come across as stalking in a western context and take away from the positive aspects, but other than that, since this film does not try to do anything too ambitious, it does not make many mistakes.

  explanation: >
    Dense, fascinating, boring, visionary, and wrong all at the same time.
    This manages to explain the foundations of reasoning as explained by pre-Socratic philosophers and Aristotle himself.
    He manages to reduce all non-tangible items to first principles, monads, and forms.
    At the same time, he brings non-rational concepts into the conversation such as essences, will, and goodness which have no empirical basis.
    This is a mixed work, but also a work to be studied due to how esoteric it is.
    One thing that surprised me was how concepts like Newton's first law of motion and functional programming were being discussed at a basic level almost two millenia prior to when such concepts became conventional.
    Overall, it is a two-sided work that is flawed and rationally prophetic which makes it a good work to use to test or tune one's intuitions by further breaking everything down through successive gradations of abstraction.

    This is like a satire of DC comics which took inspiration from DC, Dragon Ball Z, and Akira.
    Very entertaining and a bloody alternative to currently available fare that is easily bingeable.
    While it can be predictable at times, that does not stop it from being engaging.
    Animation is well done, but it can be obvious when the animators took shortcuts and used CGI.

  explanation: >
    Great, never boring, and always epic.
    While the story is above average and can be considered good, the tension, pacing, and sprawling landscapes in which battles take place are what make this engaging.
    For characters there is a bare minimum done in terms of development which for this film was all that was needed to make it feel complete.
    Although it is not historically accurate, at times, it does feel like the film places you right in the middle of the time in which the story takes place and details the British forces and Zulu forces quite well.
    The acting was well done, and it felt very much like a western in spirit despite the setting.
    The last act in particular was shot incredibly well with camera movement being quite mesmerizing.

  explanation: >
    I've wanted to read the work of Alfred Tennyson as well as familiarize myself with Arthurian legend, so this allowed for me to kill two birds with one stone.
    The prose is handled very well, which is to be expected of a poet and words flow from one to another beautifully in blank verse.
    Although the term idyll is used in the title, this is not idyllic, but rather tragic with the idylls starting from Arthur's rule to ending with Arthur's death and the dissolution of the round table.
    Similarly, although in popular culture, Arthurian legend focuses on things like Excalibur and the grail, the idylls included the ugly parts of the story with details of Arthur's illegitimate birth, and the presence of Christianity in every part.
    I would not say this is ground breaking, but it does provide great prose with a classic story of heroes.

  explanation: >
    A very ambient and surreal game that feels almost like a choose your own adventure book where you don't really choose anything.
    The story is convoluted and bizarrely paced albeit written with great prose.
    In fact, this felt more like a novel than a game with gameplay changing only to vary the way in which the story is told in the many acts the game presents.
    Themes of death and debt are found throughout the story.
    The soundtrack is interesting which a mix of ambience, some country songs, and a few songs that sound like something Pink Floyd would come up with.
    For a point and click style game, this was strangely engaging despite struggling to understand everything thoroughly.
    It made me want to visit some of the locations in Kentucky and also research some of the game's avant-garde influences.

  explanation: >
    Despite a new studio, a new composer, and the use of more CGI, this is a great slow burn that manages to continue the story without diminishing it.
    The story is not no longer a story of survival, but the story of a race of people.
    The use of flashbacks interspersed throughout this season was questionable, but it did not hurt the pacing.
    The story continues with the previous parallels to the Jews and Nazis during World War II, but has parallels to the Ottomans and other similar nations from World War I in addition to references to chemical and nuclear warfare.
    It is clear that this work draws from many other works such as Arthurian Legend, Metaphysics, The Old Testament, and Greek Philosophy.
    The commentary on genocide and war crimes is quite thought provoking, because it seems to convincingly try to ask the question of whether there are instances where committing human rights violations can be just.
    The story ultimately ends on a cliffhanger, and we will need to see the succeeding part to get a full answer, but overall, this is quite well thought out and difficult to predict especially when taking into account some of the existential and ethical implications.
    The growing levels of abstraction and western esotericism is truly ambitious.
    Next steps may include reading German philosophy. E.g., Immanuel Kant, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Carl Schmitt.

  explanation: >
    Cynical, well written, and well paced.
    The editing was not necessarily the best, but it was nothing out of the ordinary for the time in which the film was made.
    It operates as an effective thriller, but also offers satirical and political intrigue.
    The use of cacausian actors to play Koreans and Chinese characters was questionable.
    The psychological implications of brainwashing is interesting, and the concept of the U.S. already being compromised by foreign agents is an area of interest even today.
    Overall, this is a greatt film that aged very well despite the previous cold war being over for decades.

  explanation: >
    A very hard and dense read which is why I have decided to stop after the first volume which is in excess of 1000 pages on its own.
    This manages to offer some historical context on the effects of industrialization during the 1800's and how it resulted in reduced welfare for many due to unfair and predatory practices by employers.
    This work has the appearance of a work focusing in microeconomic effects, but it does invoke pathos to make an emotional plea against capitalistic practices which pulls it into the realm of subjective reasoning.
    That said, many of the concerns brought up in this work are concerns that are often times ignored today such as economic externalities which are imposed upon society and the greater public.
    This is a problem typically handled and regulated by governments since the externalities enter the realm of public welfare.
    Despite its relevance to the modern world, it should be noted that it is quite limited when it analyzes machinery due to a fully automated economy not being a consideration given the technology at the time.
    In addition to this, there are times when Marx oversimplifies situations or generalizes when it suits his arguments which ultimately weakens his statements.
    Overall, this is a work that manages to identify many problems brought on by industrialization, but does not offer a solution.
    Such a solution may be presented in the succeeding volumes or the manifesto written by Marx, but I've seen everything I wanted to see.

    When Hollywood is incapable of delivering, the animated works of DC can sometimes be better than the live action material.
    The Dark Knight Returns, The Flashpoint Paradox, and Assault on Arkham are such examples.
    However, this is only true based on the skill of the director the quality of the source material, so DC animated works can be hit or miss.
    In this case, it is somewhat of a mixed bag.
    This work offers a look into the supernatural side of D.C. comics and although this is a Justice League type story, other than Batman, the familiar characters one might expect are rarely seen.
    Instead, we are given a look at other characters who don't get as much attention such as Constantine and Zatanna.
    This could work, but character development is limited and in a work that is less than 80 minutes long, depth is something that is lacking which hurts the story.
    If you think of this as an episode in a long running series, it could make it more tolerable, but as a stand-alone work, it leaves much to be desired.

  explanation: >
    This is a movie that operates with no logic whatsoever which can work to its advantage as long as it does not take itself too seriously.
    In many cases, it does not take itself seriously, so it works, but the majority of the film feels like a long 3 hour slog with overacting and stereotypes that don't add much to the experience.
    The writing is absolutely terrible at times, but the camerawork is great which makes for a very confusing mess because it feels like Kubrick is behind the camera, but a complete moron wrote the script.
    Overall, a very mixed bag that relies on the appeal of the 90's to create a romance film that is worse than DDLJ and did not age all that well.

  explanation: >
    The original Justice League was a bad movie. This 4 hour flim is a significantly better one.
    With regards to Zack Snyder's previous work, subtlety and nuance is not one of his strengths, but every once in a while, he makes something decent.
    This is one such film. While I would not call this great and I question the heavy use of periodically unconvincing CGI which takes away from the image, this manages to improve upon most DC films released before it.
    In this film, the mythos of the DC universe begins to be established, each character gets the respect they deserve, and most characters get their own arc.
    In many ways, it felt almost reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings due to the scale and the lore that is being offered.
    The return of Junkie XL for the soundtrack is also much appreciated.
    What we see here is a story of triumph in terms of a director's passion as well as within the film's story itself, and the universe being established is quite promising.
    For the casual filmgoer and fans, this undoubtedly makes for a satisfying experience.
    The 4:3 ratio was strange, but it makes the film really feel like something out of a DC comic which makes it a success to me at the end of the day.
    It shows a certain level of care and it offers something you cannot find in the Marvel films which makes it quite unique despite its shortcomings.

    For a movie with an original premise and study of drinking culture, this is unique and definitely worth watching.

    This felt personal, and the music was well done and memorable.
    Use of Irish culture as a sort of backdrop for the coming out story presented here was a nice touch.
    The primary mechanic of erasing memories to move forward makes sense, but also feels somewhat tedious and may detract from future playthroughs.
    That said, it also is short in duration, so many player may not mind so much.

    Despite this being a short read with very simple English, it is not required reading for American students which is a very strange thing.
    This contained the Constitution, and all 27 ratified amendments including the Bill of Rights.
    Reading this now, it feels that the work was quite forward thinking in terms of how it allows for U.S. law to be dynamic in nature.
    That said, it also feels outdated in that it does not seem to consider changing technologies, human relations, and paradigms.
    The use of amendments to allow for the document to be a living document is well thought out, but it seems as though this document won't be able to keep up with the speed many developments we have today.

    The first of Ryan Coogler's collaborations with Michael B. Jordan and Ludwig Göransson.
    As a first film, this is well made and covers one of many police shootings.
    The first hour is basically build up of the characters and in the last 20 minutes, we watch a man die.
    We know exactly what will happen, but it is still engaging throughout.
    There are a few minor problems, however.
    The roles played here are not that challenging in that every character is fairly normal in nature.
    In addition to this, the camera was shaking when it did not need to be.
    Finally, if there is some sort of message, it was not the clearest and requires some background knowledge on race issues and police issues in The United States.
    That said, for a debut film, it is well done.

    Woody Allen's sharp dialogue and script are what make this a great film.
    Some of the references are dated, but this has aged relatively well and it will get a few laughs.
    While this is a story about a relationship, the conversations meander between many facets of life that may be considered mundane.
    Commentary about driving, death, relationships and antisemitism indicate the variety of topics the script visits in no particular order.
    As a result, it can be fast paced, but also meditative in a way due to the way it muses on an eclectic collection of subjects.
    Probably the best Woody Allen film I saw so far.

    This was published in the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written.
    While everything covered here can be learned in a far more efficient manner from a microeconomics and macroeconomics textbook, the historical context makes some of the content interesting.
    What is surprising about this is the level of detail by which the sophisticated networks through which money and value exchanges hands is described.
    This talks about almost every industry during the time from rent to land ownership to the financial considerations involved with slavery.
    It compares and contrasts between different countries during the time such as India (described as the east Indies), the Dutch, and the colonies in America.
    It is truly quite impressive, but it is not an easy read. It is also very rarely an enjoyable read and is quite dense.
    Although Adam Smith is said to be the father of capitalism, if the contents of his book are anything to go by, the merchant trade enjoyed capitalism or some primitive variant of it since as far back as the ancient Greeks.

  explanation: >
    Great film that reminded me of 400 Blows and Requiem for a Dream.
    This film directs its gaze towards the homeless and children living on the streets of Bombay.
    The film manages to depict the uncertainty of living on the streets from the perspective of a young boy who is trying to save up money to go back home.
    This is a movie where nothing goes right for the characters and everything ends badly.
    In that sense, it is similar to Requiem for a Dream, but this came out more than 10 years before Requiem for a Dream and has a different pacing and editing style.
    This burns more slowly, and as a result, there isn't a time when the viewer is ever feeling all that great.
    There are no clear ups in this films, which means that it is very much a slow burn of suffering.
    I have heard that this is based off of a Brazilian film called Pixote, so that may be something to watch in the future.

  explanation: >
    I have read the allegory of the cave before, but this is my first time reading Plato's Republic in full.
    While this is focused on concepts such as what is the best way to govern and rule, it makes a number of tangents to cover other grand topics.
    The exploration of these ideas is presented in the form of a Socratic dialogue where Socrates basically debates with a bunch of straw men to prove his point.
    The argumentation and reasoning is outdated, but the topics covered are still quite relevant today as they are very central to civilization and being human.
    I think if some of the arguments were stripped from their context of being used in favor of certain topics such as whether justice is good, it may have been less messy and easier to digest.
    That said, it was an interesting read, and the age of the work also implies that things are kept bare-bones in terms of narrative structure and devices.
    The only bells and whistles here are the many allegories used to prove certain points.

    The prose is well written, and the content is thoughtful.
    I was not the biggest fan of this, but it does manage to do what it set out to do quite well.
    There is an underlying complexity to all the characters presented that speaks to the flexible nature of man and how he is influenced by the forces around him.
    The focus on vanity and mortality as Dorian Gray ages without physical change is well done.
    For me, I personally could not care less about Dorian Gray as I read this novel, so its impact is lessened for me.
    The way in which Dorian Gray struggles with the choices he makes is quite similar to Crime and Punishment, but the consequences and torment of questionable actions do not seem to be quite the same which is quite interesting.
    There are a number of quotable moments and takeaways, so its acclaim is understandable.

    This was enjoyable, but mixed when viewed from a critical angle.
    The duo of Kamal Haasan and Madhavan is great, but underutilized.
    The buddy travel dynamic is the best part of the film, but the decision to use up almost half of the runtime on a flashback is simply a bad decision in terms of pacing and unnecessary in terms of character development.
    This may be a result of it trying to be a mass movie and a movie with an emotional hook which results in it trying to do many things at once.
    There is communism, humanism, capitalism, and other isms, which is fine, but for many of these themes, discussions are often only surface level.
    I think a general audience would not have a problem with this, but streamlining certain parts would have been pragmatic decision that would have strengthened the film as a whole.
    The main lesson of God and love are great and are delivered very well in the final act of the film.
    Overall, this is a film that has great parts, but did not live up to its potential.
    I may consider watching Planes, Trains, and Automobiles next since it apparently does something similar.

  explanation: >
    This is quite an achievement in terms of premise, gameplay, and mechanics and is comparable in quality to that of a Nintendo game despite it being an indie game stemming from a thesis project.
    I have personally been waiting for more games to use a groundhog day style mechanic in a meaningful way and this is the first work that has satisfied me.
    In addition to this, the physics which were somewhat inspired by real physics is quite welcome and adds a level of immersion when the player is forced to struggle with the controls of the spacecraft.
    The way in which different events only occur at different times within the timeloop means that there is an added level of exploration involved.
    You may have explored a planet fully, but as time passes, more may be revealed.
    Because of this, this manages to strike a good balance between exploration and exploitation while managing to weave a story that is coherent and manages to touch upon hard sci-fi themes that are often covered in Arther C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov novels.
    It may not be cinematic, but the philosophy by which it operates manages to successfully execute one of the core parts of games which is playful exploration and improvement.
    It is one of those games that manages to move the medium forward.
    If a game came out with a similar Groundhog Day mechanic with a bit of urgency and character interaction like Edge of Tomorrow, I think all bases will be covered with this type of premise.

    This movie by Jean-Luc Godard is a French New Wave film with very experimental editing and camera movement for the time.
    It makes references to American film while paving its own path in its approach.
    The way it displays Paris, plays with language, and seems to mimic and subvert other crime dramas from 1940's Hollywood was quite interesting.
    The acting by the duo of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg was very well done with Belmondo's role coming across as an exaggeration of a traditional 1940's protagonist who frankly does not give a damn.
    Overall, while it may not seem remarkable in comparison to the many generations of films that came out afterwards, for its time, it feels very unique.

    This is a film with an almost meandering pace that you can get hypnotized by if you enter it with no expectations.

    Saoirse Ronan's acting as a teenager from Sacramento was quite convincing, and the often subtle humor matched the pacing quite well.
    For a coming of age story, this felt quite real and relatable.
    I'm not sure if this is one of those movies with a particularly memorable plot (especially given that this is one of those coming of age stories), but it was quite well executed while I was watching it.

    A story of Ponyboy Curtis who is from a low income group known as the Greasers in th 60's and is constantly getting into fights with a higher income group known as the Soc's.
    I have a mixed opinion of this novel despite its praise.
    While it does seem to have some similarities to Catcher in the Rye and Camus' The Stranger, this does not seem as profound.
    This is understandable because this is a young adult novel, but the general takeaways and musings seem very basic. Universal, but basic.
    Other than that, it doesn't ever feel terrible, but the way in which characters interact with each other seem unrealistic in the way a writer may embellish their prose with unnecessary details to make it flow better.

    I don't know if Katsuhiro Otomo is in semi-retirement, but I wish he would be more prolific.
    This is what I imagine is a spiritual successor to other similar works consisting of shorts that Katsuhiro Otomo worked on like Manie Manie, Memories, and Robot Carnival.
    The biggest difference between this work and its predecessors is its main theme being focused on Japan and the use of CGI which was still developing during the time of its predecessors.
    While I believe the predecessors (Memories in particular) will have a greater legacy, this was rather impressive and reminded me of the artistry involved in animation.
    The fact that one of the shorts in this was nominated for an Academy Award should speak for its quality.
    My personal favorites within this collection is that of the opening sequence by Koji Morimoto and Buki yo Saraba.
    The ending song of 夢であいましょう from the NHK variety show that ran in the 1960's was a welcome touch, but it did surprise me since I imagine it would be considered a very obscure reference for any Japanese person born after the 1970's.

    A best selling indie game from the creators of Bastion.
    This feels very similar to Bastion except the setting is slightly different and the gameplay has a more strategic approach which emphasizes experimentation.
    In terms of art and sound design, it also feels very similar to Bastion, but it has less of the dynamic narration that Bastion was famous for.
    The story feels like something that can only be described as fantastical science fiction.
    It is hard to make sense of it, because it is more fantastical than it is science despite it taking place in the future or within a simulation.
    In that sense, it is somewhat similar to TRON.
    Character development is good and bad at the same time, because I know very little about the motivations of the characters, but also because the player spends a lot of time with them.
    In terms of gameplay and content, this has quite a bit of variety and manages to keep things fresh by packing everything within a short play time.

    A very shrewdly constructed mature game that is superior to the previous entry in every way and far more streamlined.
    This is less buggy and manages to create a great balance between open world and linear design.
    In addition to this, the combat and mechanics are far better and feel fluid despite its difficulty.
    The first parts of the game has a momentum that is not shared by many games, but this game does lose that momentum over time which is somewhat unfortunate.
    The story is deliberate and shrewd to put it lightly.
    This is a game that values player choice, but the story is very messy in the sense that your choices have consequences that are realistic and can result in complex outcomes.
    Unlike traditional stories, this does not alway have satisfying results, but that is part of what makes it unique.
    If you choose to kill everyone, you get some satisfaction, but doing so can feel out of character if role playing is a priority.
    Similarly, if you decide to choose the lesser of evils like a witcher may, you may find that the climaxes are not climaxes, but rather whimpers.
    There are not many games that are willing to allow for the player to do such a thing, but this is one that is confident enough to deceive and overturn expectations.
    Great, but imperfect. I am interested in the next game which may allow for plot points to be resolved, greater variety, greater scale, and some level of resolution as hinted by the story.

    My first Greek film.
    This is a strange film that has an interesting premise, but I was not a fan of the execution.
    I imagine for most audiences, the opinions on the quality will most likely be divided.
    The premise of children who cannot leave their home is reminiscent of Peter Pan while their outlook is reminiscent of Plato's allegory of the cave.
    That said, this did not exactly focus on the existential angle and spent more of its time on the psychological and surreal.
    In that sense, it somewhat succeeds with its bleak visuals, but the lack of variety in the scenery can definitely make it feel as though it drags.
    Overall, it is thought provoking, but lacking in some aspects to make it what I would consider to be a great film.

    Pretty much every part of this film is good, and the portrayal of 1960's America is fairly accurate.
    The historical accuracy, particularly in its depiction of LBJ, was not, but everything else felt real to the point that it was almost like a documentary which is an accomplishment to be noted.
    The main aspects that are particularly good are David Oyelowo's acting and the self control of the director to not dramatize anything and just show what is happening.
    The way in which some aspects of America have never changed make this film and its contents still relevant today.

    A good underdog story of a man trying to bring low cost air travel to India.
    It can be melodramatic at times and although they had access to real planes, they chose to use CGI instead in some scenes.
    Cinematography is decent, but the acting is probably the best aspect of this film.
    The pacing is also well handled and the film moves along without feeling slow.
    The level of detail with regards to how it describes commercial air travel and the logistics is very interesting and helped fill in some gaps in my knowledge with regards to the aerospace industry.
    Overall, it is enjoyable and crowd pleasing.

  explanation: >
    A clumsy and sub-par game that has heart.
    It has lore, and quite a bit of thought placed into its world building and story telling.
    Voice acting is sub-par and the gameplay and UI is clunky.
    Much of the game is spent going back and forth between different places to complete quests which can get tedious and even frustrating if you become aware of how much time is being wasted.
    For 2007, this is also not all that graphically advanced or well optimized.
    Voice acting or localization left quite a lot to be desired.
    This reminds me of the first Mass Effect, but unlike that game, this focused more on the rpg elements.
    There are romances, but they are fairly shallow in nature.
    As a result, it was less cinematic and I enjoyed it less.
    Conversely, the story and some of the moral choices which involve choosing the lesser of two evils places players in situations that many games do not do.
    It is strange to see a game handle story well, but fail in gameplay.
    I believe the mistakes made here are easy to fix and a remake will result in a great game.
    I would be interested in the sequel or a more cinematic approach to the contents here like a film if one ever gets made.

    Another great Mani Ratnam film.
    I was expecting this to be similar to Nayakan, but unlike Nayakan, this is less of a crime drama and more of a drama in the classical sense like a Shakespearean play.
    This is not so surprising, because it seems to be somewhat based off of the story of Karna from the Mahābhārata.
    Cinematography is great as always and color grading is well done with all scenes having an orange hue to represent the sun and the main character played by Rajinikanth.
    Music is by Ilaiyaraaja, so an older sensibility is to be expected regarding the main theme.
    That said, it does have some grandeur that gives the film a feeling similar to that of a spaghetti western at times.
    Action scenes feel dated, but do not take away from the film.
    Acting and the general simplicity of the themes of family and justice were one of the greatest strengths of this film with Rajinikanth showing that he could actually act with nuance.
    This is a deliberately made film that showcases the expertise of all who were involved.

    I have bought into some of ARK Invest's financial packages and while the general philosophy behind their strategy aligns with many of my values, this is the first time I have listened to the people behind the company.
    While I am not thoroughly impressed due to a lack of rigor regardign what they consider to be "innovation", they seem to be the most knowledgeable out of most of the companies that I buy ETF's from and their definition conforms with the neoliberalist trend of growth based investment.
    They are also the only company offering packages that focus in technological advances in different industries.
    Also, like Cathie Wood, I also believe a sizeable correction will be inbound. With regards to when, I am not quite as sure, but it is unlikely that stocks will be going up forever.

    I did not enjoy this and I find the sequel to be the better film.
    Usually, with film, story and plot are the most important aspects, but with this, the visuals are given more emphasis.
    While the visuals were given a tremendous amount of work, they don't look all that great to me.
    On a technical and historical level, this has value, but the story is not that great.

    This is very different from other musicals that I have seen.
    It has the feel of a musical for a stage, but it also has the feel of a low budget indie film.
    This felt like a cross between Pink Floyd's The Wall and Spinal Tap.
    What this offers which many films don't offer is a conversation on gender and the idea of feeling whole.
    When this is combined with the unique state of music in the late 1990's and the fall of the Berlin wall, it feels like it is ahead of its time and also frozen in time at the same time.

  explanation: >
    This is a film that blows other films in the same genre out of the water.
    The script is always filled with sharp content, and as long as you realize that everything in the movie is a caricature, the film works as a stylized comedy that does not slow down.
    Because of this, as long as you don't take it seriously, this film will deliver.
    When compared to other films like The Hangover or Superbad, this feels smarter and almost feels like it has an element of improvisation which makes it feel more genuine and better executed.
    The soundtrack is composed of mostly already established music from popular culture, but the choice of music used is appropriate.
    That said, it makes many references to politics and other sources that might make it effective today, but may affect how this film is received in the future.

  explanation: >
    An imperfect, but fun film that is carried by the performance of Jessie Buckley who plays the lead role.
    The concept of country music being enjoyed and generated outside of the U.S. feels like common sense, but until this film, I have not considered it.
    This film is not particularly groundbreaking, and the general progression of the main character does not seem to be paced all that well, but it is able to generate drama by presenting conflicting decisions where the main character has to choose between her dreams and the worries of her current life.
    One thing that is quite interesting about this film is that it is not overly romanticized, and it shows a more realistic outlook on the music industry as a whole which worked to the benefit of the film.

    I have no idea if this is a good movie or not, but the imagery is on another level.
    In a word, it is psychedelic, and while it seems to initially be a reference to Christianity, the inclusion of tarot cards, astrology and other pseudoscientific aspects make it difficult to pin down.
    This is thoroughly original. It breaks the fourth wall, and it has sequences that are downright confusing.
    Production quality is high and on a technical level and it feel like the budget is much higher than it truly is.
    It is difficult to critically analyze this film, and I have not read any of the literature that acted as inspiration for this film.
    It is also difficult to recommend, because I think people's opinions on this will drastically differ.

  explanation: >
    By the Roman emperor who was also a philosopher.
    I have seen the lessons mentioned here repackaged and retold in multiple ways in many other stories and self help books, so I found that I did not learn much here.
    That said, this is clear and to the point and it covers quite a lot of ground.
    Unlike more derivative works, this has very little fluff.
    While this is an overview of the stoic philosophies of Marcus Aurelius, it is not quite the same as the works of Confucius or other philosophers.
    Rather, it feels more like many musings that have been organized after the fact.
    The organization of the books means that there is no conversation between multiple parties or a narrative.
    Because of this, it is possible to read different parts at different times without losing much in terms of clarity.
    I think this work is important and the way it covers topics like perception and its relation to oneself is quite important for handling feelings of failure, pride, and entitlement.

    What this game does well is art, sound, and puzzle design.
    It tells a simple story of childhood friendship, but the story does not get more complex or detailed than that.
    The mechanics are interesting and similar to Braid in that you can reverse and speed up time to solve puzzles.
    What is different about this is that it does it in 3d and utilizes occlusion and global events to add challenge to figure out what to do.
    The two main character are always controllable through the flow of time, but other mechanics allow for some objects within levels to ignore time and move even when time is frozen.
    This makes non-linear thinking an important part of the process.
    I found the puzzles interesting. Only big flaw is that there are a number of bugs related to display and progression that can be blocking, but they are never overly frustrating.

  explanation: >
    This isn't the type of book that you read for enjoyment.
    The contents are that of a dystopian novel that felt somewhat similar to The Giver, but this had more of an emphasis on theocracy and freedom-- specifically reproductive freedom.
    I honestly don't know what to make of the contents of this, because it feels extremely unrealistic and also somewhat dated.
    The idea of a autocratic theocracy popping up overnight in the form of a coup within the United States is not impossible, but the way in which it is described here shows a lack of research regarding government, military, and economics.
    That said, it is thought provoking and mirrors organizations that we have seen in the past as well as in other countries.
    The book even correctly cites Iran and the Phillipines as having similar constructs.
    With regards to the characters, I felt that was well done and well thought out.
    Subtlety is the name of the game in a society like the one described here, and this books manages to handle subtlety and nuance well.
    For me, it is a mixed bag, and I felt it to be slow, but I can recognize that mileage will indeed vary for different readers.
    Edit: After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol" target="_blank">2021 storming of the United States Capitol</a>, this may not be quite as unrealistic as initially stated.

    A story of the final moments in the bunker where Hitler died.
    Most of the World War II movies I have seen have excluded the German perspective, so this film which takes an unbiased look at the German side felt fresh.
    Although Hitler has committed atrocities, he was a human, and a realistic portrayal helps to provide a more educated outlook on the war as a whole.
    Bruno Ganz as Hitler is accurate. He gets inflections and small details right and performs his job well.
    The desperation on the German side towards the end of the war is made very clear in this film and the educational value of this film should not be understated.
    It is an impressive film that felt real and hits hard.

    I originally confused this with Zhang Yimou's Raise the Red Lantern due to somewhat similar topics which I plan to watch in the future.
    This is an ambitious story that is difficult to watch.
    The story is rich in Chinese culture and follows the country through the eyes of opera actors starting in the 1920's.
    In this sense, it is very similar to Bernando Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, but unlike that film, the settings are not quite as grand, this has more Chinese culture, and is completely in Mandarin.
    The topics this film tries to address are quite daring for the time. Not only does it try to display Chinese opera in detail, but it also covers the rise of different factions such as the CCP, the cultural revolution, and homosexuality.
    This is a tragic story that is quite reflective of the experiences of those who lived during the time and does not try to shy away from showing what happens if it can.
    If I were to say that I enjoyed it, I would be lying. This is not the type of movie that you enjoy. This is the type of movie that you experience and it is a great experience at that.

    A solid game with well optimized gameplay that does not have many flaws.
    The story is large in scale, but it works and can actually work as a part of the Greek mythos with some modification which is rather impressive.
    This is not filled with ridiculous amounts of content, or the greatest variety of enemies, but somehow this manages to have just enough to stay entertaining and compelling.
    Levels have enough variation, boss battles are unique, the platforming is not frustrating, puzzles are reasonable, and the camera is not that bad despite it not being controlled by the player.
    Despite this being a PS2 game, it still manages to provide a sense of scale in some of the larger levels in a way that even some modern games struggle to do.
    It is clear to see that this game pushes the PS2 to its limits even though I am able to emulate it at more than 1080p resolution with little difficulty.
    Since the story shown here is a full arc that has a satisfying conclusion, I have to wonder what point there is in playing the sequels, but I am curious to see how technical improvements over time can affect the fundamental gameplay.

    This two part film was directed by Anurag Kashyap who also directed Black Friday and is another great film.
    This is a film that has great pacing and a guerilla style of filming which made me get lost in the film in a way that I forgot about the meta aspects of the film.
    The way in which we watch generations of gangsters grow and die is hypnotizing and felt as though I was watching a piece of history with the rise and fall of different factions.
    Although this is stylized, this is never rushed and each scene has its own carefully thought out pacing which reminded me of Scorsese's Goodfellas.
    It is apt to compare this to Goodfellas and The Godfather, but it should be noted that this is trying to do something different and should be judged on its own terms.
    This film follows the development of its characters along with the development of India which makes it a masterful weaving of crime, family, country, politics, and the trends of the times.
    Definitely one of the best films of the previous decade.

  explanation: >
    A game that has clearly had a lot of work put into its story, sound, and art, but is lacking on a technical level.
    This is unique in that it has characters from Disney and characters from Final Fantasy games (specifically FFVII, FFVIII, and FFX).
    Gameplay is clunky, and frustrating. The camera is controlled by the trigger buttons rather than one of the analog sticks.
    Platforming is tedious, combat lacks depth, and magic is a pale imitation of what can be seen in the Final Fantasy games.
    A decent number of the voice actors from Disney the movies voiced their characters here which was a pleasant surprise.
    Character models are less animated in comparison to their film counterparts, but due to this being an early PS2 game, that is to be expected.
    The inclusion of Disney worlds and settings is quite shallow with character motivations and traits from the films being excluded or only touched upon on a surface level.
    The way in which levels are set up encourage exploration which is similar to other Square games and a secret ending is provided to reward exploration.
    Music is good with remixed versions of Disney music being unremarkable, but music made specifically for the game being incredible.
    This original music elevates the work and overshadows its flaws with memorable leitmotifs.
    The story is a standard hero's journey with a fight between darkness and light, but quite endearing at times.
    I believe many of the problems in this game are a result of the time it was made in, and that future games should improve upon the flaws.

    A modern retelling of Baital Pachisi.
    I had no prior knowledge of story, so my impressions are based on the film alone.
    It is a solid neo noir story that tackles the topic of morality, and black and white.
    The editing was distracting and made shots shorter than they needed to be to artificially generate excitement.
    Outside of this, the dynamic between Vikram and Vedha was great and both roles were well acted.
    It is to the extent that all other actors ended up dragging down the film due to being outshined by Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi.
    The interactions between Vikram and Vedha are well written and feel very similar in quality to interactions between Deniro and Pacino in Heat or the interactions in The Dark Knight.
    Overall, great film with some flaws that seem to be less of a problem with the film and more a characteristic of the tastes of the demographic it caters to.

    This is Bong Joon Ho's best work and probably the best Korean film I have seen so far.
    This is a director that has consistently done good work and of the films of his that I have seen the only one I did not find all that enjoyable was The Host.
    It is a total homerun of a film that feels like a 1930's black and white film brought to the modern age.
    The symbolism and commentary on the divide between classes and the current state of late-stage capitalism is fairly obvious, but not presented in a way that comes across as preachy.
    The content is genre bending and original.
    It is a black comedy, a thriller, it has horror elements, and finally it becomes somewhat Tarantino-esque towards the end.
    The depiction of a rich family and a family of scam artists is interesting and counterintuitive.
    Surprisingly, the more educated individuals come across as the least clever which works well for the comedy, but it leads to some thought provoking discussion as to how accurate this is about the real world.
    There are a lot of things packed into this that can make multiple viewings worthwhile.

    A series that tries to converge all the different D.C. universes and realities through an epic conflict.
    Since this came out in the 80's, this is complete with many of the conventions of that time.
    Dialogue can be cheesy and unrealistic.
    In addition to this, the way in which the story was told was needlessly wordy.
    The costume designs are obviously dated.
    The physics of the multiverse is bizarre and impossible.
    Overall, it was a chore to read and not that enjoyable, but it did provide some historical perspective on some major and many minor D.C. characters.
    It was somewhat fun seeing three different versions of Superman fighting together, but because of the scale of the story being told, the multitude of characters made the story feel crowded and convoluted.

    A very enjoyable film by Wes Anderson that takes place in a caricature of a future Japan.
    The main characters which are dogs speak English, and the humans speak Japanese.
    This is a strange choice, but it makes for an interesting presentation of the exposition and dialogue.
    Animation is well done, detailed, and aesthetically unique.
    The use of Japanese and English feels awkward at times, but in a Wes Anderson film, that can actually work towards the film's advantage.

    This is imperfect and rough around the edges, but it has many merits.
    The first is that it has a good cast with notable figures such as David Bowie, Kitano Takeshi, Tom Conti and Sakamoto Ryuichi.
    The premise is that of the experience of POW's in a Japanese prison camp in Java during world war II.
    The story is unflinching and shows a somewhat realistic representation of how the Japanese treated POW's.
    This is surprising, because the director is Japanese, and typical protocol is to deny or ignore the actions of the Japanese empire during world war II.
    Although this is an English and Japanese language film, I recommend using subtitles, because the English of the Japanese actors is not the best and Tom Conti's Japanese pronounciation is imperfect.
    Music is probably the best part of the film. I would consider the score in this to be Sakamoto Ryuichi's best work and even better than his work in Bertolucci's The Last Emperor.
    The flaws of this film are that of a general awkwardness in structure and acting.
    There seems to be a difference in western and Japanese styles of acting which results in a certain dissonance.
    Camera movement is not the best, but shot composition can be great at times.
    Finally, characterization was not the best, and it is questionable who were the main characters and why certain characters had a greater focus than others.

  explanation: >
    A short story that is about the heat death of the universe.
    It involves a series of succeeding civilizations and entities asking a universal computer how to reverse the rise of entropy.
    I have no idea what a universal computer is, but if it really existed, it probably would not have any vacuum tubes and would be more sophisticated than what was described in the story.
    The story is interesting, because it tells the story of how sentient life evolves over time intervals of growing levels of magnitude.
    It also alludes to a cyclic model of the universe which I think should be explored more often in science fiction.
    Of the stories that Isaac Asimov wrote, this is one of my favorites, but like many works of science fiction, it fails at characterization and emotional investment of the reader.

    Although this is a fictional story, it felt real and quite personal.
    The story manages to paint a detailed picture of how Afghanistan developed and some of the demographic and cultural challenges that existed in the country and how they changed or worsened over time.
    Its unflinching treatment of rape, abuse, war, ethnic cleansing and the harsh nature of Islam in Afghanistan made it quite impactful.
    The American perspective offered by the main character immigrating to the U.S. from Afghanistan to escape conflict is nothing new, but the Afghani perspective made it unique.
    Overall, it helped me to better understand the middle east as a whole, provided some perspective on the region, and left an emotional impression.

    A great series run as part of the noitamin A programming blcok about children raised for consumption as human cattle trying to escape the farm they were raised on.
    This was never predictable and always managed to defy my expectations in interesting ways which is very rare.
    This has elements of many dystopian stories, but also has an element that is similar to a fairy tale as the name Neverland suggests.
    There are parallels to the human slave trade, current farming practices, as well as a deep conversation on purpose and what it means to be free.
    The allegorical aspects of the work should be noted.
    In terms of flaws, pacing could have been improved, but the source material may not have the same constraints that the series has, so it may have been better to read the manga.
    That said, this is easily one of the best works of Japanese story telling to come out recently and it sets itself up nicely for a second season that has a high level of potential.

    The only Thai film I have seen before this was Ong Bak.
    This was quite entertaining despite containing mistakes that I think the casual movie-goer will notice.
    While the concept of a heist style of storytelling is not completely new in television, it is quite novel within film, and the Thai perspective is an interesting one.
    The way this is filmed is exciting and stylized in a way that is not seen as qiote often nowadays and is usually not done quite as well when it is.
    Camera work and shots are handled extremely well and I have no complaints regarding the cinematography.
    The actual script could have used some work, mainly because most people who have taken a standardized test would understand how unrealistic some of the events in this film are.
    This could be mainly because the film was intended to appeal for the general Thai audience, but certain plot devices used can be jarring at times.
    That said, this is a fun heist film that manages to create engaging drama while also offering commentary on education and income classes within Thailand.

    While I do consider this to be flawed, I also consider this to be underrated as well with regards to critical acclaim.
    Clint Eastwood is one of the oldest active directors right now, but he still managed to make a compelling film despite his age.
    Richard Jewell is the story of a security guard that foiled a bomb attack in 1996 and was later investigated as a main suspect of the bomb attack he helped partially prevent.
    This is a film that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, manages to never get boring and stay emotionally impactful.
    It also manages to shine a light on problems such as malpractice and questionable actions by the media and government agencies.
    With regards to its flaws, it is somewhat simplistic in nature with many details lacking when it comes to character motivation.
    This is made up for by the skills of the actors, but most viewers who reflect on the film afterwards will most probably notice this.
    That said, I did enjoy this and thought its presentation of Richard Jewell's story was compelling.

  explanation: >
    Despite the critical acclaim for this film, I was not quite as impressed due to the what I considered to be a lot of wasted time.
    I believe this film could have been shorter and been more effective.
    In addition to this, I felt that it was lacking details with regards to the contents of the Pentagon papers which i believe resulted in a reduced impact.
    Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep performed well in their roles.
    The film was also able to successfully recreate the time in which the papers were released and paint a decent picture of how the Washington Post operated during that time.
    In terms of execution of the story, I was not as convinced.
    There is very little nuance or subtlety, and the messages that the film wanted to put forth were repeated in obvious ways that made it come across as though it was insulting the intelligence of the audience.
    Spielberg has made better films, and when it comes to films about journalism, there are better options like The Insider, Spotlight, Good Night, and Good Luck as well as All the President's Men.

    This, along with Parasite, got quite a bit of attention at Cannes in 2019 and rightly so.
    In many ways, this did for me what Call Me By Your Name could not and I consider this to be the better film.
    This was quite focused and functions as both a period piece as well as a romance story that is centered around women.
    The absence of men in this film was rather striking and the focus on painting in the 18th century was also interesting.
    The film is meditative, but not slow.
    Scenes can be sensual, but are never explicit and always have a certain tastefulness about them that fits with the rest of the general aesthetic.
    Color is used quite well in the film and mimics baroque and rococo art styles.
    I am not sure how it managed to do it, but this made me focus on nuances without boring me.
    This is a great film. I do not recommend watching this on a plane, however, due to the content.

    This is a haunting and dreamlike game that has the player exploring an island that has a similar look to that of the coast of Scotland.
    The only thing the player has the ability to do is move and choose the paths they take to get to the end.
    In that sense, it is a true walking simulator and feels like something a writer would make.
    The story told through the branching paths and requires multiple playthroughs to properly piece together the different paths to make a coherent story.
    Music is good and play time is short.
    On a technical level, the source engine and its quirks are on full display and as a result, it suffers from a few display issues.
    Generally speaking, this is thought provoking despite the small team that was needed to create it.
    The way it plays with the player's perception is probably most similar in approach to that of an M. Night Shyamalan film when executed correctly.

    My second Fellini film and my first fully Italian film.
    This was very interesting. All the dialogue was dubbed over in Italian, because the video was recorded without sound which gave the film a more surreal feeling.
    That said, the film was fairly surrealist to begin with, and the meta narrative of a film maker basically making the film that he is in is quite create and unique.
    Camera work is iconic with all scenes feeling like they had something special.
    Compared to many other films, this one is particularly dialogue heavy.
    It manages to take a simple story and turn it into commentary on art and relationships.
    There are many layers to this film, and I think it is very well suited for multiple viewings.

    This is a memorable game that manages to have an impact despite its somewhat smaller scope compared to other games.
    The game is accessible and I think it can be enjoyed by players of any age.
    Its design is relatively linear, but it had enough branching detail for players who have a more exploratory style of play.
    The subject matter is heavy and deals with the concept of mortality and sacrifice.
    Sound design is well done and also memorable.
    The music felt similar to many of works by studio Key and the game itself shares many similarities with Maeda Jun's works.
    Similarly, this also had many Japanese elements due to the background of the main developer Laura Shigihara who was also the composer and composed the music in To the Moon.
    When compared to To the Moon, I consider to be definitely superior with a better balance of story and gameplay and a more relatable story.
    I think this is one of the rare games that manages to enforce feelings of empathy and is definitely worth a playthrough.

    This is the definitive drift racing game, and the mechanics are handled very well.
    Different types of cars handle differently, which means that every car has a learning curve for mastering oversteering.
    The story mode does not have much of a story, but it is a good way to familiarize yourself with the mechanics.
    The visuals and the audio design are well done and feel similar to an outrun style aesthetic.
    There are a number of unique tracks which all emphasize different things which makes the experience stay fresh.
    The general feel of this is not like Initial D due to the lack of a Eurobeat soundtrack, but for a racing game, this is close to the top out of all the racing games I have played so far.

    This is a movie that has 3 languages: English, Italian, and French.
    With regards to this movie, this is a film with a lot of firsts for me.
    This is the first Italian language film that I have seen, the first Timothée Chalamet film that I have seen and the first film I have seen where homosexual men are the main characters.
    The film is well crafted with everything about it coming across as intentional and deliberate which places it on a higher level than many other films.
    In addition to that, I found it to be well acted and thought that Timothée Chalamet was deserving of his nomination for the academy awards.
    In terms of impact, I would say that it was not as impactful as I would have thought it would have been given its critical acclaim, but all of the acts of the narrative were well paced.
    That said, this is probably the type of movie that I would grow to appreciate more after multiple viewings.
    One final thing I appreciated about this film is how it references many works of literature I have never heard of which makes it a good movie to watch if you want to supplement your reading lists.
    After watching this, I would like to also watch the other films in Guadagnino's thematic "Desire" trilogy.

  explanation: > 
    After about 1 month's worth of delay, Space X finally carried out the SN8 high altitude flight test where they tried to test the belly landing.
    The altitude was not as high as what was originally planned, but it looks like the test was useful.
    It seems like this system has decent engine out capability as shown by its ability to fire different engines at different times.
    I expected the starship to take off based on the hop tests, but I was skeptical about whether it would land since they were doing the belly maneuver for the first time.
    Surprisingly enough, it was on target.
    I saw some interesting things in this test. The first is that some parts of the skirt seemed to catch on fire during the burning of the engines.
    The switch to an upright position during the landing also seemed to happen very quickly which won't be appropriate for a crewed flight.
    Finally, the landing burn happened far too late. I believe the landing would have been handled much better if the engines had a more controlled burn over a longer period of time and started firing earlier.
    I have high hopes for the next high altitude flight test.

    A series by NHK that I found to be a lot more rigorous than programming that can be found in American television or British television.
    The only series that I can consider to be even remotely comparable is Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.
    Unlike many similar programs that can be found in western media, this actually shows some mathematical syntax and explains how some essential formulas were developed over time in the 20th and 21st centuries.
    The four videos cover four topics which are particle physics, mass, the beginnings of the universe and string theory.
    As it presents these topics, the formulas associated with them and the researchers who discovered those formulas are covered in detail.
    The audience is taught fairly difficult concepts like the different types of symmetry, super symmetry, Calabi-Yau manifolds, partical physics, spin, M-theory, etc.
    Unlike other programs which may highlight the standard researchers like Einstein, Hawking and Newton, this program actually covers many researchers who are just as deserving of recognition despite not being covered as much in popular media.
    We are introduced to Dirac, Yang Chen-Ning, Matvei Petrovich Bronstein, Shinichiro Tomonaga, Yoichiro Nanbu, John Schwarz, Higgs, and many others who have been awarded for their research.

    This is not the best film directed by Philip Kaufman or even among the best horror or science fiction films that came out within the 70's.

    The practical special effects are well done.
    The writing in this film is good in many places and bad in some places, which is why I am conflicted with this.
    That said, it is a good film and it makes many relevant points through its premise which can be applied to modern culture's views on conspiracy theories and contagions.

    I consider this to be Zhang Yimou's return to form after many disappointing films.
    The narrative here is not particularly novel, but the third act felt almost Shakesperean and the duels felt reminiscent of jidaigeki films.
    The strength of this film is its visual style and cinematography which manages to make the entire film feel like an ink painting or a work of calligraphy.
    That, combined with the use of Daoist principles and concepts, make it very well done.
    When compared with movies like Hero this does not have a moral, the soundtrack is minimal, and the spectacle is on a smaller level.
    While this may not appeal to a larger audience, from a critical perspective, this is carefully crafted and technically consistent and original.

    What this shows is that the application of neural nets to problems that humans and traditional computing are unable to solve can result in satisfying results.
    The approach used here was apparently one that leveraged the graph-like structure to apply an attention based neural network to the problem.
    That said, there isn't an updated paper, so details regarding the architecture are a bit unclear.
    In the Nature paper, Deepmind used convolutional blocks and stochastic gradient descent which does not seem all that novel, so I am curious to see what changed between now and January.

  explanation: > 
    It was originally announced that there would be no Red Bull BC One this year due to COVID-19, so this completely took me by surprise.
    The competition felt weird because there was no audience in the stadium.
    That said, everything else was good.
    The lineups were good.
    The judging made sense.
    Commentary was good.
    The camera work was actually not that bad this time.
    The MC was sub par, but acceptable.
    The music was acceptable with some good tracks.
    Starting at the quarter finals meant that everyone had a fresh set of moves that they could use for the entire competition.
    Shigekix winning was not surprising at all given that he competed at a high level from a young age and the level of conditioning that he had combined with his musicality was simply incredible.
    What is even more surprising is that his current form compared to two years or even one year ago is on another level and the rate of improvement is something I have not seen before.
    He simply smoked all the competition in such a way that he made the strongest competitors look mediocre.

    This game's strengths lie in its gameplay.
    The shooter mechanics are fluid and the use of slow motion was also nice.
    It felt similar to Half-Life, but the physics were not used as a mechanic by the player.
    It also felt like Halo, but the weapon selection and enemy variety was limited in comparison.
    What makes it unique is its horror tropes which seem to be inspired by Japanese film.
    However, that premise was not fully utilized which prevented it from being as great as the other games mentioned.

    A surprisingly modern film that is quite representative of the times it was made in.
    During the late 90's and early 2000's, mainstream film had quite an experimental streak with many films playing with time such as Nolan's Memento and Zhang Yimou's Hero.
    This film is not different, and like Hero, it also plays with color for each of its characters.
    Because of this, it is not particularly original given the films that preceed it even when compared with Mani Ratnam's other works like Alai Payuthey which also played with time.
    Even the quick editing felt reminiscent of some of the earlier works of Darren Aronofsky and Danny Boyle which also came out during the same time.
    That said, I enjoyed this simply due to its momentum, tight script, and well acted characters.
    The use of three colors for three characters, three ages, and three classes to highlight strata within South Indian society was well done.
    It's main glaring weakness are action scenes which Mani Ratnam seems to struggle with for some strange reason despite his ability to film choreography for music and large groups of people.
    The music is modern and the use of Tamil lyrics combined with modern genres is handled very well.
    Its runtime is long, but it does not drag, making it time well spent.

    A short story about an AI called AM that tortures humans within a virtual world without allowing them the option of death after human civilization has collapsed.
    The premise is interesting, and I have seen similar concepts in other science fiction stories, but this is the only book to try to thoroughly explore it.
    That said, the exploration of the premise is not that thorough mainly because the story is short.
    The way in which AM tortures humans makes sense, but does not seem to be the most effective way of causing distress and pain.
    I would have expected the form of suffering to be less physical and more psychological, but perhaps such schemes cannot be covered within a short story.
    It may be interesting to also play the game that is based off of this.

  explanation: >
    This is a novel that offers a lot of clarity regarding Jeff Bezos as well as the growth of Amazon.
    Although Amazon is currently one of the largest companies, the journey that was taken was not always one of an upward trajectory and was filled with ups and downs.
    The emphasis on the customer as well as Amazon's culture and Jeff Bezos' volatility offers quite a bit of insight into the company for those who are only familiar with Amazon's public face.
    Another interesting thing to note is that although Amazon is viewed as a tech company today, this was not always the case, and it is interesting to how a company that is older than Google managed to live through the tech bubble and the recession of 2008 to become what it is today.
    One thing that I found myself agreeing with is that information should be presented with some narrative, and this strategy should be more widely adopted.
    This has many similarities with Walter Isaacson's novel about Steve Jobs, but I think this is worth the read despite it being, in my opinion, inferior to Isaacson's works.

  explanation: >
    Despite the heavy theme of mortality, this film can have surprisingly light hearted moments.
    When compared to a film like Ikiru, I preferred Ikiru, but this is unique and easier to digest.
    The character of Anand was original and memorable which his primary characteristic of making friends with everyone he meets.
    The uniqueness of the main character is what made this film, and without him, this would have not been as memorable.
    This combined with the death of Anand made for a story with a lot of depth that was presented in a minimalistic manner that anyone would be able to appreciate.
    Outside of Anand, there were no mistakes made, but camera work and other technical achievements were relatively unremarkable.
    Overall, it is understandable why this is praised as one of the best Hindustani language films.

  image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Soma_Game_Art.png
  explanation: >
    The title of this game originates from the Greek word 'soma' which means body.
    This is a game with a great hard sci-fi story that had above average gameplay.
    On a technical level, it was superb with distinct levels, good dialogue, and some of the best sound design I have seen in a game.
    The post-apocalyptic underwater setting was similar to Bioshock, but the use of detailed claustrophobic underwater habitats/facilities helped with the horror aspect of the game.
    The story is what impressed me the most, and it seemed to draw on many of the same themes as that of Ghost in the Shell and The Matrix that touches upon concepts of free will and conciousness which is often covered within classic Greek philosophy.
    The gameplay mostly consists of a series of sequences where you try to get from point A to point B while avoiding certain monsters that you are powerless against while navigating some moral dilemmas that don't affect the ending.
    For someone who has made video games, and understand how game engines work, the horror was not quite as effective for me and had a certain level of predictability, but the jump scares were sometimes effective.
    For a hard sci-fi story, there isn't a big reveal at the end, and the story has many smaller reveals that give the story a slow burn.
    The concepts covered in this game also have some repercussions for technologies that might be developed in the future such as teleportation, digital legacy, cybernetics, simulation, and the technological singularity.

  explanation: >
    This book makes a distinction between shallow work and deep work and states that deep work is more valuable because it leads to new ideas and is not easily replicable.
    This is partially true, but only if the shallow work is something anyone can do. If you are used to doing something that no one else can do, it can be shallow.
    Because of this, on the face of things, this book seems to offer sound advice for deep meditative working conditions, but it also fails to quantify the effect of deep work in a rigorous manner.
    It may be preferable to actually read the research behind the book rather than the book itself, since the book seems to be directed more towards a general reading audience.
    That said, since I am used to completing a lot of different types of work and using an algorithmic approach, this book was not quite as useful for me.

    I was impressed by this work by a Taiwanese Indie company.
    The gameplay is like Ori and the Blind Forest with a little bit of Metroid mixed in.
    The story is a tragedy with a little bit of cosmic horror mixed in.
    In fact, this is probably the one of the only works of cosmic horror that I found to be effective although the way in which it was presented may have been a bit lacking.
    The use of multiple endings based on whether the player finds all of a certain item in multiple locations was a nice touch.
    It is not particularly groundbreaking, but what it manages to do, it does very well.
    The mechanics of single directional jumping is not completely original, but it is used very well.
    Art direction is well done, and the general environment design and color pallete felt reminiscent of high budget anime films from the 1980's and 1990's.
    Although this is Taiwanese, this felt like a work that might have been made in Japan a few decades ago.
    The music is well done and memorable.
    Overall, this is a great game that deserves better marketing.

    A surprisingly well written short story that managed to make a somewhat prescient premise that manages to predict the internet, social media, content creation, automation, and environmental collapse.
    This is particularly impressive when one considers that the story was written more than 110 years ago.
    Like many other works during the time like The Time Machine and Brave New World, this draws on dystopian themes as well as older philosophical works like Plato's Allegory of the Cave to make an entertaining read that is thought provoking.
    Overall, this is original, but also feel dated which adds to the charm.

    I enjoyed this more than The Departed, but The Departed might be the better film from a critical perspective.
    This film is one of the best Hong Kong films I have seen, and its strengths lie in its editing and pacing.
    The idea of having moles on both the side of the criminals and the side of the police works here just as well as in The Departed, and the setting of Hong Kong made the film feel fresher when compared to The Departed.
    The use of Buddhist themes to supplement the premise was also interesting.
    This is good in its own way and functions as a great thriller while the Departed is more of a drama.

    This is a good film with casteism as its primary theme.
    Films like this can get preachy, but this film is not.
    There are many aspects of this film that are educational.
    There are different dialects of Tamil presented, and as well as a profile of different castes.
    We are shown what college life is like in South India, as well as the concept of quota.
    There are also references to B. R. Ambedkar not only in the script, but also with the use of the color blue.
    Acting by Kathir in particular was well done with his ability to effectively express emotions with just his eyes.
    On a technical level, there are many shots and sequences that are fantastic while there are some jarring sequences that could have been improved with better editing.

  explanation: >
    This is not so much a game, but a tool for establishing a habit of meditation.
    While I did not find it useful for mindfulness, it helped me establish permanent nose breathing and reduced sensitivity in my sinuses.
    This has a variety of meditation techniques such as abdominal breathing, breathing for calmness, breathing for relaxation, guided audio meditations and offers a visual guide to match your breathing with.
    Unfortunately, it is missing holotropic breathing and Wim Hof breathing as well as other techniques.
    By utilizing this game, I have spent more than 10 hours meditating over a period of more than 140 days.
    The game allows for the player to choose the duration of the meditations to fit their busy schedule, but the longer the session, the better the results.
    I recommend a minimum of 8 minutes per session for the best time to performance ratio.
    To go from beginning to completion requires patience.
    With regards to the game itself, the primary goal is to grow an ecosystem by meditating.
    The more days you spend meditating, the more the environment grows.
    Once the game is completed, you are given an island that you can walk through and plant trees in.
    The trees grow the more you meditate.
    Overall, this is not perfect, but it seems to be the best meditation app I have found so far and should be effective for most people's purposes.
    This is also one of the only meditation apps I know of that offers a spatial connection with the meditation.

    This is a great game.
    It is ambitious despite providing a linear experience and offers a high concept story that is thought provoking.
    In the case of this game, while the gameplay seemed fairly standard when compared to the first Bioshock, it is the story that makes it shine.
    Unlike the first game which takes place in the underwater city of Rapture, the main campaign of this game takes place in the floating city of Columbia.
    Unlike previous games, this felt more like an American take on a Jules Verne style concept, but backs up the extraordinary premise with quantum theory which was researched by Procopiu and Bohr close to the same year in which the game takes place (1912).
    Characters are convincing, and the main AI companion of Elizabeth was both endearing and well developed without being an obstacle during gameplay.
    There are quite many concepts covered in this such as alternate realities, free will, and other existentialist themes.
    This, in combination with many social issues that plagued the United States in the early 1900's made for a very unique experience.
    The Burial at Sea missions offered an interesting connection with the events in the first Bioshock and offered an interesting continuation of the main campaign.
    Overall, there are not many games that are as polished and well thought out as this one, and I consider it to be one of the greats.

    This is a mediocre film where Michael Moore visits different countries to learn what they do better than the U.S..

    This is a game that is rough around the edges, but has quite a bit of depth and ambition.
    This also manages to provide one of the few convincing implementations of the hero's journey in games in a way that does not represent the world as simply black and white that I have seen.
    This is a game that had a good idea, a good premise, good music, good mechanics, good voice acting, and a unique story, but struggles on the technical side of things.
    There is a richness in assets with different enemy types, high character customizability and freedom that is common in open world games and MMORPGs.
    That said, the world is small and not all that populated.
    NPC AI can be limited which can make the world feel shallow despite the detail that it has.
    This can make the game tedious at times and also frustrating due to its difficulty.
    This is a game that moves slowly.
    This can be a good thing because it can emphasize the player's investment, but it can also make for a negative experience for more casual players.
    Overall, I enjoyed it.
    It has quite a bit of replay value, and it encourages exploration.
    If it were fleshed out more and had more depth to the non-gameplay related elements, it would be tremendously better.
    Interestingly enough, there is a show that is based off of this, and I am curious to see if it fares better than the game.

    This is one of those movies that is enjoyable and brilliantly shot.
    In many ways, this feels like a Disney animated film brought to life.
    For a musical, this has a certain level of intelligence in it.
    Topics like class struggle, language as a way of attaining higher positions is still relevant today.
    In addition to this, this film provides a unique window into the English language.
    Sets and locations are colorful and well constructed and music does not take away from the story.
    Hepburn does great in this as she does in everything she is in and she outclasses all other actors in the film.
    While many musicals can be quite shallow this manages to go deeper to provide an engaging experience.

    I knew of Toge Productions since the times when they developed flash games.
    In addition to this, some of the unity assets that were used in this game were used in some of my games as well.
    I was rather surprised to see that Toge was based in Indonesia this entire time.
    Coffee Talk is a visual novel style game that is similar to other bartending games, but in this game you are a barista that serves coffee.
    The crux of the gameplay involves experiencing the story through the customers that visit the store.
    These customers are made more interesting due to the world that the game takes place in which has fantasy elements in a modern world like Bright or Fables.
    These elements are utilized in a way that they are able to tackle themes like racism, traditionalism, and general societal changes.

    Multiple playthroughs make the content engaging, and it is interesting to see how the news affects individual people from different walks of life.

    This is an example of a good premise being wasted.
    Time manipulation is something with many possibilities, but in this game, the possibilities are limited.
    In addition to this, the use of time travel without any sense of strategy made it feel like a standard first person shooter that just has scenes that take place in the present and the past.
    You as the player have no decision making in how the time travel works.
    In additon to this, enemies either fall into generic soldiers or generic monsters.
    The mechanics are simply not all that compelling.
    Story is given through exposition. Only the variety of weapons seemed decent.
    Overall, this is like a substandard Bioshock clone.

    This felt like the western world's equivalent to 人間失格 and like an adult's version of Catcher in the Rye.
    Although the contents of this are said to be absurd, this felt very real, and may not be considered all that absurd in our modern world.
    The purpose of life and the emptiness in it are well conveyed.
    Unlike other great novels that I've recently read, this actually felt like it had impact and it was straight to the point.

    Audrey Hepburn carried this film and her acting was what made this work.
    The ending really tied things up for me in a satisfying way.
    Most jokes are funny, but Mickey Rooney's performance as Yunioshi felt unnecessary and lacked the cleverness that could be found in the rest of the film.

    This is one of those games where the medium is able to take advantage of its capability to hybridize itself with other artistic mediums.
    In this case, it manages to create what is essentially a film with choice.
    While other games may have cgi characters, this is composed of fully acted FMV's that have quality that is similar to what may be found in decent modern television dramas.
    Some acting in this can be lacking, but the main character is well executed.
    The story itself is not anything particularly innovative. It is a heist-gone-wrong style crime drama.
    That said, it is entertaining.
    It shows potential in the future of gaming and television and is something that can offer a more personalized experience for each individual viewer.

  explanation: >
    This released worldwide earlier than it did in the United States.
    The general directorial feel of this is that it is like a cross between something Hitchcock and Shane Carruth would come up with.
    Compared to other Nolan films, this is very stripped down with most, if not all, of the focus on the plot.
    As a result, character development is more limited and it is harder to find an overarching theme or emotional hook like other Nolan films.
    On the technical side, this is an example of a director who knows what he wants and executes without any compromises regardless of whatever limitations may be brought on by the premise.
    Everything is practical including many aspects of scenes that are supposed to be happening as a result of time inversion.
    In terms of negatives, the film does not pay off until the second half when the time inversion mechanic is utilized in an unrestrained manner.
    Nolan spends half of the film setting things up which can be tedious, but the payoff is good.
    That said, despite its unrestrained nature, I felt that the idea was not pushed to its limits.
    In terms of replay value, this has it due to the nature of the palindrome-like structure.
    Scenes happening in reverse are accompanied by a smartly composed score by Ludwig Göransson that also has parts that can be played in reverse.
    Acting by all players is well done.
    If you are familiar with the mechanics, you may notice most of the details and predict the second half, but this is worthy of multiple viewings despite its shortcomings compared to other Nolan films.

    This is my first Billy Wilder film and my first Marilyn Monroe film.
    The script is clever, but not so clever that it loses its comedic value.
    The setting of the 1920's made this feel like a pre-code Hollywood film due to its racy content which only added to its authenticity.
    This is also probably the only film I've seen with crossdressing as a comedic gag that was actually good.
    While this has been stated to be one of the greatest films ever made, I would not go quite that far due to some aspects of the film being good but not particularly unique or innovative.
    That said, I think this is worth watching, and that its comedy is enjoyable even today.

    An example of narrative done well in video games, and one of the better historical games that I have played.
    The representation of WWI was well done with historical context given to all of the locations and scenes that play out.
    In particular, the focus on the French effort was interesting, and something that is not covered all that often in media.
    The casualty rate of the war was well portrayed.
    While not everything was historically accurate, and liberties were taken, it managed to ground itself within actual events that played out in the war to deliver an emotional journey.
    All chaacters were given some level of development, and the story was not predictable.
    Overall, I consider this underrated.

    An update from Neuralink that was made for the purpose of recruiting.

    This is one of those movies that does not make major mistakes, but also does not make any particularly audacious moves other than its premise.
    From an American perspective this is unique in that it is a bilingual film that takes place mostly in China, and provides a unique perspective on Chinese culture.
    Awkwafina's Mandarin skills as an ABC were convincingly mediocre, and her acting, while not particularly memorable, did the job.

    Although this is a favorite of many fans of the series due to nostalgia, I found it rather tedious.
    While the ideas presented here had potential, the execution made it hard to enjoy.
    With the improvements brought by the PS2, you would expect the world presented to be more vivid, but while it feels real and feels larger, it also feels somewhat empty.
    The gameplay is more linear and exploration is not encouraged as much as previous entries.
    FMV's look great, but their in game counterparts look lifeless in comparison, which indicates that the improvements in technology did not lead to an improvement in the general player experience.
    This game could have just as easily been made for PS1, but with less complex graphics and no voice acting and it might have been improved in the process.
    The music is good, and the story seems to draw from an amalgamation of religious ideologies and South Asian/Oceanic cultures with its concepts of dying to save the world from sin.
    Side characters don't have the level of development given in other entries, and the English voice acting is absolutely horrible (which is a product of the times).
    I am sure some people may enjoy it, but when grinding and the end game feels like work, I consider the product to be flawed.

    A very unique film with good production value and film technique.
    The story is very simple, but the way in which it is executed is what makes this work.
    The dialogue is short and not particularly elaborate, but it still manages to be poetic.
    The closest thing I could think of was what can be seen in Wong Kar-wai films, but Wong Kar-wai films can be more meandering at times.
    That said, I don't think Wong Kar-wai did something on the level of the single 1 hour+ take in the second half of this film.
    Apparently this film involved three cinematographers, but I honestly had trouble telling.
    This is a dreamlike film that I am surprised has not received more attention in the west given its general quality and its success in China.

    This is a film that is completely dependent on its script and the actors who manage to sell it.
    This comes as no surprise since this is from the same director as The Princess Bride
    There is a certain cynicism in the writing which makes this romantic comedy more endearing than other entries in the genre.

    The premise of the first season is being stretched to its limit, while it is a good premise, the original idea is not used well in this film.
    This film's best aspects are the short runtime and the sound design.
    Other than that, the film seems to lack an overall focus and does not have a particular message or goal.
    The idea of mental health being related to a person's criminality is an interesting topic to cover, but the ideas are never actually explored, but rather just used as a back drop for some sort of mediocre crime drama.

    This is not an easy movie to watch, but the amount of deliberate touches and artistic flair make it something with its own identity.
    Danny Boyle has a unique style, and the methods and techniques he uses here are very similar to what can be found in Requiem for a Dream.
    Unlike Requiem for a Dream, this is a bit more light hearted, and the ending is not quite as bleak in nature.
    Ewan McGregor's performance here is great, and he executes the script very well.

    For a 90 year old movie, this surprised me in many ways.
    The level of violence was unrestrained, the themes are mature, and this ultimately does not shy away from showing war as it truly is.
    As my first pro-code film, this impressed me very much.
    Scenes of war looked very real despite some frame rate issues, and the perspective of the Germans was something that I thought was very ambitious given how controversial it might have been.
    Given that this was made during a time that was not that long after WWI, the general look of the film is very similar to what one might have seen during the actual war.
    In terms of camera work, the film felt like it was at least 20 years ahead of its time in certain scenes in terms of how it used movement.

    One of the best games I have ever played and criminally underrated.
    Everything is improved over previous entries.
    The story is mature and told with a poetic flair, the dogfights are intense, there is choice and mission variety as well as an ace style system.
    Although this takes place in an alternate reality, the war that the player experiences in this game is a mixture of WWII and the Bosnian war and references to Arthurian legend are made in parts of the story.
    The music is also better than in previous entries with a mixture of different types of genres as well as the use of Flamenco guitar as a motif.
    The planes themselves, which were designed in partnership with major aerospace companies, are also very intricate and detailed.
    In light of the series, this is not particularly innovative, but on its own merits, it is great.

  explanation: >
    A very intellectual work set in a bizarre post 9/11 future where biotechnology and AR are ubiquitous.
    The main premise is focused on an exaggerated application of the Sapir Whorf hypothesis where speaking certain words with a specific grammar can eventually lead to genocidal behavior by inception.
    There are some very unique ideas presented here such as the use of civil war as a way to enforce class separation, the rhetoric of tyranny, and the recurrence of genocide as a byproduct of human evolution.
    All of these are controversial, but all of these have some rational basis which is what makes them particularly interesting as an area of study.
    The combination of linguistics and anthropology with the direction the world is heading in is something that has only been done in MGSV.
    Depiction of American politics and military is not accurate, but it does make for good entertainment.
    Generally, the story seems like something that Kojima or Oshii might have come up with, but the presentation is lacking.
    The main problems here are the lack of character development, the flawed pacing, and the subpar presentation, but everything else is very interesting.
    I'm not sure if this would be considered a good movie, but the content of the story is very interesting.
    The novel this is based on may be a better use of time than the film.

    This is insightful, but also limited by the state of psychology during a time when it was more of a pseudoscience.
    I can also see how the arguments postulated here fit into the basis of some of Jordan Peterson's work.
    For anyone reading this, the ideas of the id, ego, and unconcious stem from Freudian psychology, so familiarity with the field should be expected going into this work.
    There is quite a bit of ground covered here.
    Carl Jung talks about the role of the individual, how the individual is constructed, how the individual can get lost in the masses, and the influences and reach of the individual within larger society.
    He frames the microconcepts involving individual psychology within larger political and societal concerns of the time like the cold war.
    Overall, this is not a bad read, and it can help one to understand one's place in the world.
    There is an emphasis on the west and religion as a foil to the state and tyranny, but I chalk this up to a byproduct of the times.

    When this was announced, I was looking forward to a stealth based game, but then PlatinumGames took over the development, and it became something different.
    The gameplay became more high paced, but it kept many elements of the original vision.
    This is a game that is very high paced, high energy, and there is very little that is quite like it.
    The story is cartoonish in comparison to other works in the Metal Gear Solid series, but as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is very enjoyable.
    I recommend reading The Selfish Gene before playing this game, because there are many references to memes.

    It is very interesting to see how intelligent humans were during a time when civilization itself as a concept was still somewhat new.
    Despite this being as old as it is, it is understandable and fairly relatable.
    This reads very much like other bronze age era stories where lessons are taught by vicariously experiencing them through some character.
    In the case of the epic of Gilgamesh, the focus is on mortality and grief.
    Although humans can live forever through immortality, this epic shows that humans can also live on through their legacy.
    It is also interesting to note how monotheistic religions seemed to plagiarize concepts from this epic.

  explanation: >
    The conclusion of the story is interesting, but not as entertaining as the first part.
    While the first part was interesting due to its exploration of the loop mechanic, the second part focuses more on character development.
    This makes it have less momentum than part 1, but a more fleshed out world.
    Unlike Edge of Tomorrow, the ending in this is far more tragic, and the mechanics by which the looping occurs is different.
    The looping in the manga is more believable and mimics the principles by which memories are sent back in time in Steins;Gate.
    Overall, I think this is a great series that is very unique, and that while this is better than Edge of Tomorrow, Edge of Tomorrow also has its own unique appeal.
    In terms of the reading experience, the vocabulary is not particularly difficult for someone who is fluent and furigana is provided, so it is not a bad way to practice Japanese.

  explanation: >
    I have a mixed impression of this film.
    While it is superior to the 70's Battle for the Planet of the Apes, the writing in this felt weak and seemed to depend on the stupidity of humans as the primary thing that moves the plot forward.
    While the original series had a certain mystery about it that had viewers piece together events to figure out how each film fits in the whole scheme of things, the reboot is told in chronological order.
    Also, anyone who knows anything about apes knows that being intelligent is not enough to speak like a human especially when the throat of an ape has not been evolved to make human-like sounds.
    In terms of positives, the subject matter is very relevant to current events.
    There is a simian flu, a weird skepticism of science among some of the characters, and a general lack of trust between the major parties.
    Drama among the apes seems Shakespearean.
    If this was better written, I might recommend it, but the use of some tired tropes made it an irritating experience for me.

    This is a story of Gregor Samsa turning into a cockroach.
    The subject matter is surreal, and the way in which the transformation was handwaved made it seem bizarre.
    The impact the transformation had on his family made up the majority of the story.
    It is difficult to say what this book is truly trying to say, but the story can be related to society, depression, and familial relations.
    For a short story, it could have been made even shorter and still accomplished the same thing, but overall, it is interesting.

    It provides enough variety to entertain.
    In terms of negatives, there is not much weapon variety, mediocre AI, and voice acting can sometimes miss the mark.
    It would have been nice to use the Russian voices, but background conversations are not given subtitles, so this was not a viable option.

  explanation: >
    Silent films are not easy to watch or enjoy due lower image quality in addition to the use of text to indicate dialogue.
    The last silent film I liked was Metropolis.
    In the case of Nosferatu, the image quality lends itself to the horror and the use of black and white works to the advantage of the lighting.
    With regards to the acting, it is difficult to tell whether the acting is good or not because it is hard for subtlety to be conveyed to the audience without the ability to convey everything through physical movement.
    That said, Max Schreck in this case is difficult to imitate, making his performance very memorable despite it looking comical at times.
    Generally, as long as you don't take this too seriously, I think it is easier to appreciate the work and craftsmanship that went into this.
    Small things such as the use of a hyena as a werewolf make this a fun watch.

    A respectable, but flawed film from a young director with mostly unknown actors.
    This clearly had a lot of work put into it, but this also seemed to value style over substance in certain aspects.
    Editing and camera work ended up being jerky and this hurt the pacing despite some common practices being followed.
    Color grading was well done.
    While this does follow tropes in the mystery and crime genre, events are spoonfed while twists and turns end up being forced with very little to prompt them.
    As a result, this ends up being a film that does some things great and some things in a flawed manner.

    Towards the end of my first trip to Japan, there were a number of sales happening to promote the Japanese opening of Edge of Tomorrow in Japan.
    As part of this promotion, the manga and original novel of All You Need is Kill (which is the source material for the film) were being sold at a discount.
    Although six years have passed, I am finally getting to reading the copy that I bought.
    Since I already saw Edge of Tomorrow six years ago, comparisons will be made.
    I consider this to be superior to Edge of Tomorrow (so far) due to the focus that has been placed on the time loop rather than the enemy.
    Characters' pasts are actually covered here.
    All You Need is Kill also does not shy away from the violence and provides a bleaker outlook on humanity's war against the ギタイ.
    The aliens that show up are different and appear far more terrifying in my opinion.
    This is also more clearly made for Japanese sensibilities as indicated by the tropes seen within the first manga.
    So far, this is very good, and I am hoping that the second manga improves on what was established in the first.

    This is classic Alfred Hitchcock where he creates suspense by withholding information from the viewer.
    By trying to piece together a case by viewing people through their windows Hitchcock creates a premise that gives him a lot of freedom.
    While the shots used are repetitive, we do see each window act as a frame through which to place the camera such that small differences are emphasized.
    Topics such as voyeurism and the ethics of observing a crime or suicide are also covered.
    In terms of acting, James Stewart was not all that impressive (because he plays James Stewart like he does in all his movies) with many of the actresses overshadowing him.
    While much of the attention towards the actors goes towards the voyeurs, credit should be given to the actors who play the role of the observed as well.
    In addition to this, there is something of a meta narrative here where each room represents a tv channel.
    Overall, there are many way to interpret different aspects of this film which makes it a work that is worthy of being studied.

    Read this in the original Japanese as a way to practice and review the language.
    When compared to the feature film, this varies quite a bit because it reads more like a modern day Indiana Jones except artifacts are protected instead of stolen.

    While entertaining, I don't consider it to be particularly different from other works that were published at the time.

    Deserves to be listed among the greatest films of all time, and is on the level of films such as Citizen Kane.

    Cinematography includes long tracking shots and creative use of lighting which works great in a black and white film.
    Imagery and the composition of each frame is carefully thought out.
    The story records how a man lived his last days and the aftermath.
    By doing so, it manages to make a statement regarding society, life, purpose, family, and work.
    In addition to this, it is also a good documentation of the state Japan was in after recovering from the second world war.

    This is more a film about Mr. Rogers' philosphy rather than about Mr. Rogers himself.
    As a result, Tom Hanks' character's screen time is limited and the main focus is placed on the character played by Matthew Rhys.
    Tom Hanks plays his character well, but not perfectly, and smaller mannerisms don't seem to be recreated.
    I think the overall story is well structured and it does not try to be overly ambitious which allows for it to reduce mistakes.
    What this does well is that it shows humans as imperfect and how to deal with a chaotic world in a positive manner while dealing an emotional message.

    Not as great as Ace Combat 4 in terms of gameplay, and not as ambitious in story when compared to Ace Combat 3.
    There are a sufficient number of missions and the focus on geopolitics, while lacking realism, manages to provide a good parallel to cold war era politics.
    One thing that is improved in comparison to the other games is that there is a clearer arc that can be followed with the characters which may make it more crowd pleasing.
    However, when compared to AC4, this also means that there is a decrease in realism.
    Levels lack variety and don't seem to offer much in terms of innovation compared to previous installments.
    The AI of enemy planes actually seems to be worse despite the fact that programming such AI should be relatively straight forward.
    Finally, unlike previous installments, there is not a single ace who acts as the antagonist within the story which made this feel somewhat lacking.
    Overall, this is like Ace Combat 4 with more content, but less refinement.
    I enjoyed it and consider it to be a cut above many games made today.
    One thing to note is that the animations seemed to be made with English in mind rather than Japanese, so English audio is recommended.

    The EU and North American versions apparently had the entire story and cutscenes completely cut out.
    Being a PS1 game, graphics and gameplay are limited in comparison to Ace Combat 4, but the basic mechanics are there, and the game feels modern.
    Storywise, this is a cut above other games due to its coverage of geopolitics and technology in a future where world powers are corporations instead of countries.

    The animation is fluid and integrates both 2d and 3d methods.
    The score is handled by Yuki Kajiura who is my favorite Japanese composer.
    That said, the writing seems to be typical modern shounen fare which means that I don't consider it to be novel despite its great execution.
    Demon slaying has already been presented in other works within the medium (although maybe not as well or in the same way).
    Despite this, there is a high amount of care given to character presentation and development, and while the plot is not innovative, it does nothing wrong.
    References to Japanese history is done well, with its depiction of a vibrant and varied Taisho period Japan.
    The story did not impress me as much as its technical achievements, but I can understand why it is highly rated since it does not make major mistakes and does a lot right.

    I have already seen Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and seeing how this is his first film with sound, it is interesting to see how he uses it to his advantage with editing.
    From a cultural perspective, it is interesting to see how Germany was in the 1930's especially during a time when the Nazi's were coming into power.
    In terms of cinematography, it is similar to Metropolis, but carefully planned shots make the compositional quality of each frame rather high.
    In addition to this, with improvements in technology, the camera is portable enough to actually follow characters around.
    A good example of this is a shot that tracks Peter Lorre's character and zooms in during a chase.
    In terms of story, this handles suspense and moral dilemma's well.
    The first half depicts the search for the child murderer well, and the last part handles topics such as insanity, the legal system, and punishment.
    Overall, a great film, and one of Germany's best.

    There are not a lot of games that have a retro eastern European aesthetic, and the look of this work is just one of its unique characteristics.
    There are references to many different works like Final Fantasy, NES games, and it uses these references to essentially steal mechanics from other games for one hit gags.
    Art direction is well done and varied with many different styles of art being included. Along with all this, there are FMV's, some of which include live action sequences.
    Puzzles are bizarre and take advantage of the strange post apocalyptic surreal world of Paradigm to create unique challenges that would not work in any other point and click adventure.

  explanation: >
    This is the most tightly constructed film I've seen in a long time.
    The editing is deliberate, and each scene has a logical flow.
    It doesn't have a dull moment, and is best watched in a single sitting.
    It is also unique, because this is one of the few films where almost all the characters have questionable morals.
    The casting does come across as bizarre, because they seem to have casted the least Italian looking people to play Italian Americans.
    This is most likely due to that fact that David O. Russel prefers to work with actors he has worked with in some of his previous films.
    If Martin Scorcese made a heist film, it might be similar to this due to the pacing.

    One of the best fighting games and one of the best games on the ps2 is also one of the most frustrating.
    For each character, there is usually more than 70 moves, and the cpu seem to sometimes cheat by using previously used moves to anticipate what the player will do.
    For many of the harder fights, it is necessary to win by using cheap moves instead of mastering the fighting system.
    Outside of that, presentation is nice, characters from different countries actually speak their language instead of using dubbing.
    There is quite a bit of depth offered here, but the game does not hold your hand and expects you to have the patience to master the movesets and mechanics for each of the characters.

  explanation: >
    For a Quentin Tarantino film, this is not his best, but is at the level of some of his other well known films.
    Much of the craziness found in other films is rather subdued in this one.
    The first 2 hours of this very long film are basically an indulgent journey through 60's era Hollywood with a focus on television rather than film.
    Some shots from older shows are recreated, and references to films from that time are made.
    In the last 45 minutes, we suddenly get a narrator, and we see some of what Tarantino is most known for.
    Historical accuracy gets thrown out the window by that point and things go from 0 to 100 quick.
    Overall, this is most similar to Inglorious Basterds, and while it is not perfect, if you are familiar with film from the era, this may be entertaining.
    That said, it does feel bloated and indulgent, and there are some scenes that could be edited out.

  explanation: >
    A very insightful book that basically shows how all forms of life is composed of greedy functions from the elements that they are made of to the behaviors that they exhibit.
    While it may imply that there is an intent behind everything, the way I like to think of it is that it is the result of stochastic processes that prioritize survival or try to optimize a particular metric.
    This is also where the term 'meme' is apparently coined, and Richard Dawkin's use of it is very creative, because it is able to use the greedy nature of genes to extrapolate to human culture and behavior.
    There are also applications of economics which can be used to determine the optimal condition, and then show how evoluationary processes can lead to local optima.
    Overall, this was very fascinating.

    I recommend playing only this in the series, because this entry even has a recap of events in the first game.

  explanation: >
    Played and upscaled on epsxe.
    Because of its age and status as what is probably the first rhythm game and one of the only rapping games, the experience was somewhat frustrating.
    Playing on easy means that you can only play through half of the songs which means that you need to play on normal if you want the full experience.
    Timings don't match up with what is on the screen which means that you need to have an understanding of the underlying timings if you want a good score.
    The visual style is rather unique for the era given that 2d animation within a 3d environment was rarely done prior to this game in many mediums.
    All versions of this game have the same voice acting and music which means that the Japanese version really only differs in terms of its menu and subtitles.

    This is like a cross between Apollo 13 and Gravity.
    This is unique in that it provides a cosmonaut's viewpoint, and it actually has a somewhat realistic portrayal of orbit.
    Music is good, but the story is not entirelyy historically accurate.
    There were quite a lot of dramatic liberties taken, and I felt that a more realistic approach might have worked better.
    Some of the liberties taken involved fabricating entire events to make partially political statements which did not add much to the quality of the story as a whole.
    That said, for something that was created on a significantly smaller budget than many of its Hollywood equivalents, this is rather impressive.

  explanation: >
    Played using PCSX2.
    This is one of the best horror games and one of the best games of all time.
    That does not mean it is perfect, but the imperfections seem to be intentional.
    Dialogue and voice acting is awkward and stilted.
    The controls are clunky, and it is difficult to find items within levels which bears similarity to earlier Resident Evil games.
    I ultimately had to switch from 3d controls to 2d controls.
    The limitations of early PS2 era games seemed to work to the atmospheric properties with glitching graphics.
    Nothing actually felt real, and this manages to actually work to the advantage of the game.
    The story, while not entirely clear, has similarities to great novels like Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Dante's Inferno.
    There are also references to Jungian psychology which is rare to see in any work.
    This game does not settle for cheap scares and delivers through atmospheric tension and strong imagery.
    Finally, the multiple endings makes the actions taken by the player meaningful.

    A great Frank Capra film that does not bore despite its age.
    In addition to being a decent comedic romance film, it also manages to make some commentary on social classes.

    On a technical level, this is superior to the original in every way.
    Hair behaves like hair when it is not stylized, water has accurate reflections, and materials have correct specularity and texture.
    Storywise, the novelty of the concept is not quite as high, but this is both a good superhero film as well as a family drama.
    The 70's silver age feel is still there, and the story continues right where the first film ended.
    This runs longer compared to other Pixar films with the runtime straying closer to 2 hours rather than the usual 90-100 minutes.

  explanation: >
    This is a hard book to read and a book that is somewhat boring.
    While the topic of whaling in the 1800's can be interesting, the level of detail and ramblings on what I would consider to be insignificant really hurt the general pacing in my opinion.
    The narrator Ishmael is uninteresting and is only there to tell the story and act as a vehicle for some of Melville's opinions.
    There is not much of a plot here, and the main draw is in its details and characters.
    While there is a lot of thought placed into the content, what Moby Dick offers would be equivalent to if Star Wars suddenly went on a tangent and started focusing on the rocket science behind the space ships that show up in the film.
    In my opinion, this had an interesting beginning and a good end, but everything in between (which constitutes the majority of the novel) was tedious to read.
    Interestingly enough, I do think the structure of the novel might make for a good game with Moby Dick being a good final boss.

    It is also not all that preachy and delivers its message without being overbearing.

    Emulated on PCSX2 and upscaled to 1440p.
    Despite Hideo Kojima being involved in this, this is not a philosophical game or even one with a particularly interesting story.
    There are some references made to ancient Egyptian mythology, but this seems to be more for the purpose of stylization.
    The gameplay is tight, but it lacks depth and variety. The player is given a variety of weapons, but enemies tend to be the same, and enemy AI is rather unsophisticated.
    For cutscenes, due to this being an earlier PS2 title, the graphics are lacking, but the main weakness is relatively bad voice acting and badly written dialogue.
    I wish I played this in the original Japanese version, but finding a Japanese rom for a legacy game console is easier said than done.
    The main strengths here are the soundtrack and the art and mech design which seems to have been done by Yoji Shinkawa.
    I felt like this had potential, but it didn't really live up to my expectations.
    Mech games aside, I've seen similar aesthetics and settings in the animated feature films that probably influenced the art direction for this game.
    That said, I am open to playing the sequel which I have been told is supposedly better in all aspects.

    This is a great minimalist film that leveraged Tom Hardy's acting to create a story with ups and downs that all take place during a drive.
    Dialogue is realistic, and the way in which phone calls progress the narrative is creative.
    Tom Hardy has always been consistently great in all his films and this film is no exception.
    Cinematography and music is simplistic, but this only serves to emphasize the acting.
    Locke is one of those films like Twelve Angry Men that shows what can be done with a limited budget and a simple premise, and it knocks it out of the park.

    Although Wim Hof is a proponent of a breathing technique, his unclear explanations and weaknesses in English make it difficult to narrow down what exactly is happening.
    This interview with James Nestor clears things up and also provides explanations on the topics such as asthma, the impact of breathing on bone structure, the benefits of CO2, and the impact of nose breathing vs mouth breathing.

    This is a great film and differs from Bombay in that it does not have a narrative or a message.
    It just shows what happened.
    In many ways, this is more like a documentary and is similar to other great films like The Battle of Algiers or Zero Dark Thirty.
    It also does not portray either side as right or wrong, and shows the flaws of both the investigators and the perpetrators of the bombings that followed the riots.
    Not only is this a good film, but I think it can be used as an educational tool due to its somewhat unbiased nature.

  explanation: >
    This is not a game, it is more like interactive fiction.
    Its strengths lie in its art and music.
    The music is great which is to be expected because it was composed by Kevin Penkin who worked on Made in Abyss.
    The story itself is somewhat standard and covers a relationship from beginning to end, but it does not get melodramatic or make any mistakes.
    From a critical perspective, this is a good game, but for those who are expecting more from their games than a story (like gameplay with more depth), this may disappoint.
    That said, I think this can appeal to a wide group of people and the short playtime makes it worth a try.

    This is free to play, and despite being a short game, it is one worth playing.
    Apparently this is inspired by Tibetan theology and philosophy.
    While I did come out of this not learning much about Tibetan theology, the art and sound direction do evoke feelings of spirituality.
    The closest game to this is Journey, but unlike Journey, this has less of a narrative.
    It is more minimalist, and this works to the advantage of the game.
    Overall, this is rather impressive for a game developed by a team of four.

    This is a hard hitting game that covers the purgatory of PTSD.
    This is also one of the few games I know of that allows players to commit war crimes and offers a criticism of the US military without needing to explicitly do so outside of text on the loading screen later in the single player campaign.
    The script is well written, and the development of the characters is well done.
    Although the story is based off of Heart of Darkness, it manages to add a layer of psychology to the story to give it a twist.
    There is a level of meta narrative here that places it in a category of its own that groups it with films like Inception.
    The setting of Dubai where water is the new oil acts as its own character and reflects the mentality of its characters.
    There are not many games that handle story telling in the way this game does, and the lack of acclaim definitely makes it underrated.

    This is one of Mani Ratnam's best, and it's emotional impact is probably the highest out of all of his works.
    On a technical level, this is comparable to Dil Se, and the camera is never needlessly static as we see in some of Ratnam's other works.
    There is a dynamism to the camera work and it helps tremendously.
    Music by Rahman with its Islamic influences is very memorable.
    The way in which this film not only tackles interfaith marriages, but uses that as a way to highlight aspects of the Bombay riots was cleverly done.
    This is heavy in imagery, the dialogue is simple but to the point, and the acting is powerful.
    As is typical with many of these Tamil films that take place outside of south India, more Tamil is spoken than is realistic, but I think that can easily be forgiven.

    This is the second game developed by Fullbright after Gone Home.
    Like Gone Home, this is an exploration style game that is short in duration.
    This time, the story takes place on an orbital station, and involves piecing together events that happened using an AI interface.
    The general design of the station and story are well done, but the short duration seemed to lessen the impact of any reveals.
    Finally, the idea of retrieving AI data through an AR interface does not make much sense.

  explanation: >
    This is the first film I saw with Amitabh Bachchan and the first film I saw that used Hindustani instead of just Hindi as its language.
    This is a fairly solid movie, but much of its appeal was lost on me.
    The reason for this is because it seemed to copy from westerns like Magnificent Seven, and Once Upon a Time in the West without improving upon those films in a significant way.
    While those films had signature soundtracks and camera work, this film seemed to be a bit lacking and simplistic in comparison.
    One thing to note is that the restored HD version has a few gimmicks that were intended to be used for 3D viewing, and it is noticeable in that it seems to distract from the actual contents of the film-- whenever there is an explosion, it is pretty much always guaranteed that there is some cgi object flying out towards the camera. 
    That said, I do have a similar reaction when I see Star Wars films nowadays, so it's not too surprising that I wasn't all that caught up with the style of this film that is so clearly designed for mass appeal.

  explanation: >
    Played using PCSX2 without upscaling with the software renderer.
    This is supposedly the best that the Ace Combat series has to offer, and while it is a great game, it is very much a product of its time and a remaster or remake would be very much appreciated.
    There are no drones, the planes are older models, and the graphics are representative of early PS2 graphics complete with dithering.
    Consequently, there is a limited simulation of atmospheric conditions with no condensation, icing or wind taken into account.
    That said, the story is grounded, the concept of anti-asteroid railgun system known as Stonehenge was innovative, and the fictional universe known as Strangereal felt very much like our own.
    The ability to hear the radio chatter of both allies and the enemy makes for a very immersive experience and is probably one of its largest strengths.
    The dogfights were intense and enemies use techniques that are common in dogfighting even today.
    The missions made sense in the context of a larger military conflict and the way in which you play an active role and affect the flow of battle is very well done.
    This is not an easy game. There is a learning curve, but once an understanding of missile systems and dogfighting techniques is reached, it pays off.

    A continuation of Half Life 2.
    There are no new mechanics introduced, so it's really more of the same.
    This is not necessarily a negative, but one thing to note is that the huge changes scene between Half Life 1 and Half Life 2 are not seen here.
    We see the return of the gravity gun, but we don't see Gordon Freeman's signaturue crowbar until the middle of the game.
    Alyx as an AI controlled partner was surprisingly tolerable.
    Overall, it's good, but nothing compared to Half Life 2.

    This is Al Pacino at his best, and I would consider this role to be one of his most defining.

    This has received quite a bit of critical praise, but I feel like what was great about it as lost on me.
    Scenes tend to be rich and oppulent, and Shah Rukh Khan plays an NRI returning home like he does in pretty much most of his films.
    The plot is unimpressive. It has elements that can be found in Sophoclean or Shakesperean plays, but the way in which events lead to other events seem hamfisted at best.
    Motivations for characters are underdeveloped, and the flowery language and interesting shots can't really save it in my eyes.

    This is rough around the edges, but it was made by mostly one person, so that can be forgiven.
    The art is not that great, and the voice acting is cheesy.
    This can work because it is partly satirical, but it's hard to tell when to take the content matter seriously.
    That said, this is a very detailed work with a lot of thought put into it although the writing does seem amateurish at times.
    From a sci-fi perspective, this is probably the only work that gets as into the details as books I've read in the genre by William Gibson or Neal Stephenson.
    This makes it very impressive because it is difficult to get across that level of detail in a game.
    The music is very reminiscent of Blade Runner, but it isn't a cheap imitation and uses elements like dialup tones, static, and gunshots to add texture.
    In addition to this, this manages to move genre tropes forward by introducing concepts like unilaterally assured destruction as an evolution of mutually assured destruction or weaponizin parallel timelines.
    This makes this a very unique game, and I don't think I've seen anything like it even when I compare it with other cyberpunk games.

    Covers mental deficiencies like dyslexia and how it can go untreated within the Indian education system.
    An interesting thing I noticed is how Indian education seems to be leaning towards processing a large number of students as quickly as possible like a factory.
    Unfortunately, it seems like this is the trend for education at all levels in many parts of the world due to increasing population, so it is questionable whether students who have certain deficiencies will receive the specialized care that they need.

    Cinematography and overall direction make it seem more like a classic film from the 70's or 80's rather than something out the 90's, and the different locations used make it hard to tell when the movie takes place.

    This movie is to Mani Ratnam what The Aviator was to Martin Scorsese, and solidifies my impression of Mani Ratnam as India's Martin Scorsese.
    This film is not Mani Ratnam's best, but the depiction of a developing India and Turkey was very interesting to see.
    This film has a certain intense momentum in parts of the story that can suck you in, and it would have been nice if the story was written to emphasize those parts.
    Abhishek Bachchan's performance as the businessman Gurukant Desai was intense and just great, making him the centerpiece of the film.
    Other than Madhavan, who managed to hold his own, other actors were either good or just adequate in comparson.
    The score by A.R. Rahman was great, but the individual songs were good but unimpressive compared to his more memorable works.
    Editing lacked subtlety and is probably the weakest part of the film due to it being more flashy than it needed to be.

    This is like Roja without the political backdrop.
    When compared to Dil Se, this is the opposite in that it has clearly good writing, acting, but a smaller budget and scale.
    In this film, the cinematography is conducted by P. C. Sriram instead of Santosh Sivan and as a result, there are some clear differences in the shots.
    With regards to Mani Ratnam's previous work, the director innovates this time by using an anachronistic structure which is not often used in films in general.
    In addition to this, this offers a realistic depiction of married life.
    While I prefer Mani Ratnam's works that feature a larger scale, this is a good film with decent cinematography and features some memorable tracks by A.R. Rahman.

    Acting also seems to be overdone by SRK and the melodrama seems to have removed any subtlety from the picture.
    That said, for Mani Ratnam's first Hindi film, this is a good achievement, and the film seems very modern in terms of technical achievements.
    In terms of songs, I think this also one of AR Rahman's best works.
    This film also covers the topic of liberationists which many in the west may not know about India.
    While it may not be a perfect film, it has iconic moments, and is worth watching despite the long runtime.

  explanation: >
    This is a road trip style comedy drama that has good cinematography.
    Out of all the Indian films I have seen so far, this is the least Indian film I have seen.
    The film takes place in Spain, the music breaks are not as abrupt as other films, and the general style seems very western.
    It presents philosophies about life through experiences on the trip and does a lot of "show don't tell".
    The way scenes of diving, skydiving and Encierro were filmed puts you in the moment.
    That said, the skydiving was somewhat unrealistic, because free fall does not last as long as they show in the film.
    I went into this with no expectations and came out impressed.

  explanation: >
    This is the first film that A.R. Rahman scored and you can tell because of the heavy use of synths.
    Roja is a very different film from Nayakan in terms of story despite both being directed by Mani Ratnam.
    This film borrows from the Mahabharatha making it a very strange film in terms of how its story plays out due to it not using completely modern conventions in its story telling.
    Cinematography is as good if not better than Nayakan.
    One thing that seems fairly obvious is that Mani Ratnam is not used to filming action and stuntwork seems amateurish.
    The political backdrop is one of the strengths of this film, and offers some context that grounds the older origins of the story in modern times.
    Overall, this is a good film that showcases Mani Ratnam's unique style.
    One thing to note is that English subtitles are mostly accurate, but do not appear to be direct translations, so some level of nuance is lost in the translation process.

    Ashutosh Gowariker and A.R. Rahman team up again to create another great film after Lagaan.
    This is also the first film I saw with Shah Rukh Khan in it.
    This time, the scale is smaller, but the writing and cinematography is better.
    Instead of historical India, this takes place in modern times and focuses on societal problems, poverty, and traditionalism.
    The concept of an NRI is explained and explored.
    There is a good visualization of a hydro electric turbine as well as shots taken at NASA during the space shuttle program.
    The GPM system mentioned in the film was an actual system that was developed and launched in 2014, which I found interesting.
    Overall, this is solid, and does not get boring at all.

  explanation: >
    Despite this having some cliches, this is a very novel and original story.
    Like many Indian films, this is a long one and comes complete with an intermission.
    I doubt that most people watch it through in one sitting.
    It is also a good way to get introduced to the rules and convensions of cricket.
    I don't think I've seen a movie about cricket and I don't think I've seen a good historical sports film that did not involve boxing or running.
    The mixture of Hindi and English make this accessible to a western audience despite some of the music breaks, which are less abrupt compared to other films.
    The classic story of an underdog is well done and characters are unique which helps the unique setting of the story.
    Acting is good, and cinematography is occasionally great, but usually mediocre.
    The setup is flawed, but the actual cricket match towards the end is very entertaining.
    Overall, this is a great film.

  explanation: >
    One of my goals when I learn Mandarin is to be able to quote the Analects from memory.
    This is a good initial step towards that goal, but it also allows for a deeper understanding of east Asian culture.
    This holds many similarities to some of Plato's works and some of the Greek works that were written during the same time.
    There are conversations between characters and anecdotes about certain characters as examples of certain principles that are emphasized in The Analects.
    The majority of this book is about this character (usually Confucius) saying a certain thing or another character saying something else.
    Filial piety, propriety, the branches of learning, the mandate of heaven, and other concepts that were tested within the imperial examination in ancient China are all here.
    There are many things here that, by modern standards, will seem sexist or contradictory.
    Overall, like many older works, this has its flaws and should be read critically.

    This is a good, but imperfect movie. Camerawork is way more shaky than is necessary.
    The Apollo mission was pretty accurate. It matched what I saw in archival footage.
    Although not historically accurate in every sense, it manages to tell a good story by dramatizing parts of Neil Armstrong's life despite his life already being somewhat dramatic.
    There are some good shots in here, but this is not Damien Chazelle's best work and it did seem like he was out of his element working in a non-music related film.

    An interesting take on internet browsing from the 90's with a twist where the users are browsing the internet while they are sleeping through some sort of dream based interface.

    I thought the series ended with the second movie, but then they made a third one and then a fourth one.
    The third one felt like a decent conclusion, but this fourth did not feel like that at all.
    Donnie Yen was good as always and Scott Adkins did well as the antagonist.
    As is typical in these types of movies, foreign influences act as an oppressor of Chinese endeavors.
    The writing felt weak in this one, but the technical quality is consistent with previous films.
    Choreography is good, cinematography is decent and Kenji Kawaii's score is good as always.
    Although the Ip Man series has a lot of fictional events, this one is the least historically accurate and it shows.

    I think this is the first non-Chinese and non-American martial arts biopic I've seen.
    Like most martial arts films, the story is not perfect, but the choreography is quite impressive.
    I think this is one of the few times I've seen Karate presented as a full contact martial arts, so punches and movements don't have clean lines like you may see in a typical form.
    In addition to that, I think this is the first film I've seen that covers the perspective of Zainichi Koreans.

    The story felt like it was written by someone who had a background in computer science or at least in the tech industry.
    Terms regarding semantics and natural language processing were used correctly, and discussions of AI did not come across as overly optimistic.
    The concept of online counseling as a way to accumulate a corpus that can be used to train a general intelligence is original despite the concept of online counseling not being an economically scaleable business in the form that was presented in the game.
    There is also some coverage of the debates regarding psychology and psychotherapy as a rigorous field of study.

    This is a movie that keeps giving and giving.
    The behavior of zombies can be inconsistent at times, but other than that, this is a tight film that knows what it is doing.

  explanation: >
    Like all Final Fantasy games, this is quite a time investment.
    In terms of how this compares to other games, this is probably the best executed, but also the safest game.
    What I mean by safe is that there is nothing particularly groundbreaking here.
    It does what has already been done in previous games in the series, but better.
    It is for this reason that I actually prefer FFVII over this.
    In terms of graphics, this improves upon FFVII. Characters no longer look blocky, and FMV's look like something out of a painting.
    This game has actually aged quite well.
    Conversely, the music is not as great as other games. That is not to say that the music is bad, but I found it lacking for a Final Fantasy game despite a great main theme.
    Battle mechanics are also fairly standard.
    Finally, the world feels less fleshed out and smaller compared to other entries.
    Despite this, I felt that the story was on par with more ambitious entries despite it not being quite that detailed due to the main characters.
    All things said, this was probably my least favorite out of all the Final Fantasy games I have played up to this point, but when I heard the main Final Fantasy theme come on during the end credits like the Disney theme comes on at the beginning of a Disney film, I felt fairly satisfied.

    In addition to this, the book uses a system mechanic that shows up in other Chinese novels to add to the the novelty of the story.
    In many ways, this is a book about wish fulfillment.
    The main character becomes a jack of all trades that stands at the top of China all because he has knowledge from the original reality and a system that gives him game-like bonuses.
    This can get old quickly, but it is very satisfying if you are willing to suspend disbelief.
    In my opinion, the biggest strength of this novel is its thorough overview of Chinese culture.
    This novel covers famous books and movies and people that have been influential in China while also covering what foreign works have been of greatest influence in the domestic market.
    There is also a decent coverage of differing cultures across the different provinces of China.
    While it may not be worth reading all 1600+ chapters that were written before it was discontinued, I would say that the first 600 chapters are entertaining.

    Stephen Chow's take on the whole gambling genre.
    It's good fun, but I would not say that it is a good movie.
    That said, it handles comedy better than God of Gamblers and for some reason exceeded the box office of the film it is drawing influence from.

    This film is considered iconic among Cantonese films, and while it has its moments, it is also imperfect.
    Part of this is culturual.
    There are abrupt shifts from comedy to serious moments, and a western audience will most likely view this as a weakness despite it being rather common within Hong Kong films.
    I feel that if it focused more on the gambling and action and less on the comedy, it might have functioned better.
    The beginning and the end are great, but the middle is not in my opinion, and the usage of a head injury as a cause of amnesia is somewhat cliche.
    It is not a bad film, but it is on the border between an average film and a good one.

    Although this is inferior to Steins;Gate, but is still a good series.
    This series builds upon the events of Steins;Gate by analyzing an alternate world line that did not have the same ending in Steins;Gate.
    In this timeline, World War III will still happen, and the gimick of AI is presented as a way for people to achieve some form of immortality.
    The strengths of this series lies in its abilities to take the mechanics introduced in Steins;Gate and expand upon them to flesh out the futures and pasts that were hinted at in Steins;Gate.
    Overall, it does not do anything particularly new when compared to the original Steins;Gate, but it manages to use time travel to tell a compelling story that drags at the beginning, but picks up later on.

    I consider the second part to be better than the first because part two seems to play to the strengths of the source material, and build off of the events in part one.
    We finally see the appearance familiar characters such as Monkey and Pig, and a reasonable conclusion to the story.
    The fight between the Monkey King and Bull Demon King was well done.
    With more modern works, typically CGI would be used for the more nonsensical aspects of Journey to the West, but this film uses practical effects which I felt added to the quality.

    It's not as bad as people say it is, but it isn't a good movie. Special effects and the score are great, acting is fine.

    There are many contradictions, hanging threads, plot holes, unexplained motivations, and inconsistencies with previous films.
    Transitions between scenes are abrupt and horribly handled.

    This is a film that is directed by Jeffrey Lau, but it stars Stephen Chow.
    This film, like many Stephen Chow films, brings in Man-Tat Ng to add Mo Lei Tau style comedy to the story.
    A Chinese Odyssey is based on Journey to the West, but this is a reimagining of the story from the perspective of the Monkey King rather than a retelling of the Ming dynasty classic.
    Some of the comedy and plot will not make sense if you don't have some familiarity with Journey to the West and Chinese culture beforehand.
    This film drags at the beginning, but improves towards the end.
    Overall, it is a good film, but execution is not the best.
    Acting and comedy is fine, but pacing and special effects do seem a little bit lacking from a western perspective.

    This is a great example of Stephen Chow's talents and Hong Kong's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_lei_tau" target="_blank">Mo Lei Tau</a> style of comedy.
    When watching this, it is clear why Jackie Chan broke through to the international stage while Stephen Chow did not.
    Jackie Chan is a martial artist that dabbles in comedy while Stephen Chow is a comedian that dabbles in martial arts.
    Because of this, the word play and cultural references in Stephen Chow's works don't translate as well.
    That said, if you are familiar with Hong Kong culture and Chinese scholarship in general, you will find that this is a smartly written film that has something for the literate as well as the common people.
    There is a nice mixture of classical poetry, Chinese opera tropes with modern references that I've never seen in western cinema and was very rare in mainland Chinese films during the time.
    If you are looking to understand Cantonese a little better or just have an interest in historical Chinese figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Yin" target="_blank">Tong Pak Fu</a> this will satisfy your needs.

    The most mentally challenging game that I ever played.
    The puzzles were difficult and were challenging despite the commonality of drawing lines.
    The philosophy and message of the game flew over my head in a way that I've only see happen in Shane Carruth films.
    For many, this can be hit or miss due to the lack of a narrative and the difficulty and abundance of puzzles.
    Despite this, I found the imagery, use of Feng Shui and Zen Buddhist ideas in combination with western philosophy and poetry to be very original.
    This is not a game that you speed through. This is a game that takes months to complete with frequent breaks away from the screen.
    While some of the puzzles can be brute forced, it is recomended that you focus more on pattern recognition unless you are an extremely patient person.

    I don't remember the last time I saw a Bollywood film if ever.
    There was also a lot more English in this film than I was expecting which was a surprise.
    This is a film that I think will appeal almost universally to the general audience and be received a little bit more mildly although positively by film critics.
    One thing to note is that since it is a Bollywood film, it is very long, people will teleport to random places and start singing, and there will be instances of somewhat overacted melodrama.
    That said, the main themes of the film such as friendship, purpose and education along with its humor and wit allow for it to be easily relatable.
    There are many things that I did find to be rather fascinating from a cultural perspective.
    I did not realize engineers were a big deal in India, and I did not realize that instructors had as much authority as they did in educational institutions.
    The closest thing I can think of to this is attitudes towards education in mainland China.

  explanation: >
    The initial premise was similar to a short story I wrote years ago except my story was from the perspective of the supervisors and not the natives of the planet.
    Childhood's End is a different take on the first contact story where the aliens have a special plan for humanity and help humanity despite not revealing their intentions.
    It is one part science fiction and one part mystery where the reader is learning of how humanity society can be improved into something more utopian while at the same time losing certain freedoms.
    The third act is probably the best part of the book despite its abstractness.
    Concepts regarding cosmic level intelligences and the evolution of life into something more formless draws from not only Greek philosophy, but also gave similar impressions as what one may experience when reading H.P. Lovecraft.
    Overall, this is an entertaining read.
    The only large complaint I might have is one that I have with other Western science fiction which is that characters seem to only be instruments to move plot forward.

    I remember watching Stalker many years ago and falling asleep in the middle of it (I still liked the movie though).
    Unlike Stalker, Roadside Picnic seemed easier to follow and denser in content despite lacking some of the philosophy that Andrei Tarkovsky was known for.
    Also, in Roadside Picnic, they actually explain what caused the creation of the zone.
    In Stalker, I was convinced that it had something to do with nuclear power, but in Roadside Picnic, it was clarified that the cause was aliens.
    The concept of the zone as a sort of Bermuda triangle on land is highly original.
    This is a short read, but it has interesting ideas. I'd like to play the games that were based off of this next if I have the time.

    I don't play a lot of flash games nowadays, but Caravaneer is such a unique series that I find myself returning to this work every once in a while.
    This is an unforgiving and long game, but if you use hacks like ArcadePreHacks, you can fly through the game and enjoy the story.
    Caravaneer 2 is a game that is heavy on story and manages to successfully build a post apocalyptic world set years after the entire world got turned into a desert.
    You have the opportunity to be a merchant and take advantage of changing economies.
    You can take part in politics and change how different factions interact with each other.
    There are many similarities to Fallout, but unlike the Fallout series, this seems to have a better thought out story and it feels like your actions actually have some weight despite its significantly lower budget and scale.
    I would like to see a sequel make it onto Steam, because it would be a shame for games like this fade into obscurity with the rest of the flash games.

    I think the last time I saw something with puppets was either Thunderbolt Fantasy or Sesamstraat.
    I don't know why they decided to use puppets, but it seems to work and effectively allows for the film to use more practical effects.
    This gives it somewhat of an 80's feel.
    Despite all that, I would consider this to be a unique, above average comedy.
    It seems to mix subtlety and over the top comedy to create an interesting commentary on the war on terror, American foreign policy, activist actors, and geopolitics.
    In spite of this, the issues are dated, making it difficult for viewers from a younger generation to fully appreciate the jokes.
    The best part of this film are the songs.
    The puppetry is not that sophisticated.
    The movie is aware of this, and pokes fun at the puppetry.

    The most in depth interview with Elon Musk that I have seen so far.
    It covers his entire life and is not afraid to get very technical.
    This interview hits many different areas such as finance, management, programming, manufacturing, materials science, and physics.
    It is a good video to remind you how engineers should approach problems and how technological progress should be conducted.
    I wish there was more on Neuralink, AI, and maybe even a little more on rocket technology, but there are other interviews and talks you can watch that more than make up for the deficiencies of this video.

    An overview of Pytorch that not only covers the library, but also the general deep learning workflow.
    This explains what tensors are, different loss functions, as well as how to create forward and backward functions.
    It also explains activation functions like RELU.
    Comparisons and differences between Pytorch and Tensorflow are covered.
    Overall, this is a good introduction to the library.
    I recommend watching at 1.25x speed.

  explanation: >
    This is a book that covers the top 20 most spoken languages.
    While I don't like how information is presented, it does the job, and it provides useful information for any aspiring polyglots.
    Each language is given its own chapter, but what is discusssed for each language varies. Some chapters discuss words and grammar while other discuss culture and history.
    This inconsistency is what I find to be the largest problem with this book, but if you can get past that, you might find it to be palatable.
    One thing I appreciated was its coverage of loan words.
    It made it easier determine an order in which to learn languages based on which languages were influenced by others.
    E.g., learning Chinese before Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese, or learning Arabic before learning Persian, Turkish, Swahili and Hindi.

  explanation: >
    The cinematography in this film is its strongest point and it is all due to the skills of Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes.
    There are not many weak points in this film other than its premise.
    The attention to detail and the ambitious nature of the long takes makes it a film to be studied like Birdman and Rope.
    Every second of this film felt real and highly immersive.
    This is one of the few films I can think of that could actually be improved with a higher frame rate.
    In terms of WWI films, I consider this to be better than Paths of Glory.
    In terms of verisimilitude, the entirety of this film is comparable to the D-day sequence in Saving Private Ryan.
    In terms of quality, I'd say it is neck and neck with Saving Private Ryan where Saving Private Ryan had better character development and 1917 had better action and technical milestones.
    It is that great and it makes a strong case for more WWI movies.

    I'm not a big fan of South Park, but I found this funny and thought it was decent in its execution.
    The game is like an episode of South Park and it plays like an rpg without many of the annoying aspects.
    In that sense, it is approachable to a casual audience and does not end up being too time consuming.
    Fans of the show will like this, but others may find the show to be a bit much with its outrageous humor.

    This is a book explaining most of the reasoning for Andrew Yang's 2020 presidential campaign.
    I found it to be insightful and thorough in its coverage of societal pressures, changes in the economy, and the future of the United States.
    It also talks about certain concepts that are rarely talked about like social credit, cognitive bandwidth, and it questions what a college education is actually supposed to do.

  explanation: >
    A playlist of videos that make the mathematics of machine learning far more accessible.
    Granted, you don't know machine learning if you don't know how to use matrix representations of the concepts, but it is a good way to have a conceptual understanding of classifiers, regression, and other techniques.
    I'm not a big fan of the presentation style, and the videos tend to be towards the longer side, but I think that this is one of the better resources on Youtube for machine learning.
    This seems to lack certain concepts like Bayesian approaches, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and Laplacian point estimation which is unfortunate, but it is a good starting point.
    I would have also liked to have seen more on how to optimize hyperparameters, as well as a gradual progression into more mathematical representations of the concepts.
    This might be good for a programmer who just wants to know how the apply the concepts, but if you are in academia and are trying to do research, write a paper, or study for an exam, this is lacking.
    That said, resources for ML on youtube are either limited or lacking in pedagogical quality, so most people will need to settle for this.

  explanation: >
    Unlike the Russel and Norvig textbook, this is more of a speculative book that fouses more on what may be possible rather than the current technology.
    It analyzes and extrapolates what may happen in the future as AI improves and how society and the human race will change as a result.
    It compares and contrasts many different scenarios. Overall, it is well thought out and well researched.
    There are many references to other works that I read such as Thinking Fast and Slow, Homo Deus, Sapiens, I Robot, etc.
    Overall, I found it to be a serious treatment of the field that was grounded in reality and tried to provide possible guidelines in terms of how to think about the technology.

  explanation: >
    I now use this in place of meditation because playing this game at high speeds allows me to easily enter the zone.
    This game is one of the best games I have ever played and it proves that the Tetris Effect is real.
    The game of Tetris is simple, but in combination with the sensory stimuli and effects powered by Unreal Engine 4 allows me to reach altered states very quickly.
    Although it does make players enter the zone, it does not do this artificially.
    You will actually become a decent Tetris player by the end of the journey mode if you play in normal or expert difficulty.
    I have never had a game do anything like this to me ever.
    It is imperfect, but the flaws can easily be improved.
    If speeds and difficulty can be adjusted as the player plays, this can allow for altered states to be entered far more quickly.
    A larger variety of music tracks and visuals would also be appreciated.
    Finally, if the game can take in biometric data like heart rate into account, I think it may be possible to do things other than just enter the zone.
    Highly recommended not only to gamers, but to everyone.
    I think this has therapeutic aspects that can be very <a href="https://youtu.be/7T7mg6JZZzg" target="_blank">useful</a>.
    I would really like to try this with VR if I get the chance.

  explanation: >
    The last film I saw on my Delta flight to Amsterdam.
    This one was above average, but it had holes.
    Character motivations seemed contradictory at times, but it was definitely thought provoking.
    The concept of a machine raising a child is something that isn't covered very much in fiction.
    Many ideas are presented, but I would have liked to have seen the exploration of a single idea at greater depth.
    It felt as though it were trying to tackle many themes at once, and I felt that weakened the film as a whole.
    It may be just me, but I feel that as I learn more about AI, the films about the subject don't seem to hold up with the most recent literature.

  explanation: >
    It has been a while since I've seen an indie film with a low budget.
    Jim Cummings absolutely nails it not only with his directing, but with his acting as well.
    He singlehandedly sells the film and the long duration shots that had him really flex his acting chops made the film something special.
    I didn't seem to be the intended audience of this film with its themes of divorce, fatherhood, and loss.
    There were awkward moments in there due to the mix of comedy and heavy drama, but somehow Jim manages to make it work.

  explanation: >
    This shows exactly what happened during the Apollo 11 mission and nothing else.
    There is no extraneous narration and all footage was footage taken during the mission.
    Picture quality is great, and you feel like you are experiencing exactly what the world experienced when the mission happened.
    It blows my mind that some of the sequences and shots they had were actually taken during the time of the mission.
    I didn't realize they had the technology for some of the techniques that were utilized at the time.
    Overall, an undeniably great documentary.

  explanation: >
    This is like a cyberpunk Uber simulator.
    Most of the game plays out like a sophisticated visual novel that takes place within a car.
    Concepts like automated driving vs human drivers, automation, quantum decryption and AI are touched upon.
    The emotions of the main character and the navigation of complicated conversations and social situations like handling gaslighting are well done.
    For an indie title, it is solid, but as a game, it is lacking in details.
    The world outside the cab feels almost desolate. You don't feel as though you are in a large city.
    It's a low budget game, so assets had to be kept to a minimum but additional details would have made it way better.
    I'm not asking for high graphical fidelity, but a more realistic world.

  explanation: >
    This one got better critical acclaim than it did with general audiences.
    I think I can understand why.
    Ad Astra is an introspective film that takes place in space.
    Unlike Interstellar or Gravity, this focuses more on relationships and seems to be deliberate and comparatively minimalistic.
    Other similar films focus more on action and suspense.
    Rather than comparing with more modern space films, this should be compared with Solyaris or 2001: A Space Odyssey.
    If you want a succint summary, this feels like a cross between Solyaris, 2001, and Apocalypse Now.
    That sounds like a pretty good combination to me.
    The focus is on character and cinematography, and I feel that it succeeds in that respect.
    In addition to this, while it is not completely realistic, it does seem real enough to seem possible.
    Similar to 2001, Ad Astra also hints at what commercial space travel and tourism might look like and it is very convincing.
    Overall, I feel that it is highly underrated and that we need more films like this in the genre.

    This is an arcade style game with storytelling in the style of Bastion.
    It draws from the exaggerations made in old western dime novels.
    There were many moments in here that reminded me of The Unforgiven.
    Overall, it was fun. Nothing groundbreaking, but fun.
    The two endings were a nice touch.
