  explanation: > 
    Neutron is making a larger rocket. This one is similar to the Falcon 9, but it is made of a carbon composite instead of aluminium-lithium alloy.
    As many may know, carbon is  difficult to manufacture, but Peter Beck argues that Rocketlab can use it quickly and integrate it easily within their 3d printing process.
    So, if this all works out, we may get a highly reusable rocket with a better benefit cost ratio than the Falcon 9.
    In this case, they also manage to keep the fairing by making it a part of the first stage and hold the second stage.
    It should be noted however, that this rocket design will always land at launch sites instead of sometimes at sea like the Falcon 9 which may limit mission envelopes.
    Based on the profile of its deliverables and payloads, it also seems like it may be shorter than the Falcon 9, but it should also be noted that it is wider and the Archimedes engines have higher impulse and will be lifting a lighter rocket.
    I'm looking forward to see how this compares to Falcon 9 and whether this can be made a reality.

  explanation: >
    This is a discussion of the limits people place upon themselves which prevents them from reaching joyfulness or peace.
    In this case, much of what is examined is the past, present and future's hold on one's thoughts which are preventing people from living in the moment.
    In many ways, this is covered by Sadhguru's Inner Engineering, but since this predates that work by decades, one can think of this as a more intellectual version of the aforementioned work.

  explanation: >
    A great indie game developed by one person.
    As a space sim, this strikes a good balance between casual play and world building such that you don't need to micromanage everything.
    The way the story unfolds adds another dimension to the gameplay, because you have to explore an entire galaxy to piece everything together.
    The general feel of this is as though you were placed in the middle of a Star Trek episode where you meet new races and decide interact with them as you travel through space.
    Really, the only thing that I felt was somewhat lacking was the depth of content, but for one person, this is great.
    If there is a sequel, I would like to see more character interactions and greater rpg style world building, faction building, and character building.

  explanation: >
    The hardest philosophical work I have read and the extensive use of German based terminology such as Dasein did not help.
    The primary concern of this work is to ask what it means to be or exist.
    Heidegger makes references to Hegel, Kant, and Descartes in an attempt to explore this, so prior reading is to be expected.
    In this work, Heidegger calls into question the ontological underpinnings established by philosophers like Kant and Descartes and asks whether an object and its properties can truly be separated.
    Later on, he adds the effect of temporality into the mix to show that existence is a temporal phenomenon.
    While this is not quite as logically dense as Kant, the reasoning provided by Heidegger to jump from one topic to the other looks very much into human perception as a way to explore what existence is, what it means to exist, and intellectual blindspots.
    Because of this, the existence Heidegger analyzes is that of human existence as opposed to existence in general.
    I did not understand everything due to the density of the text and a lack of experience with phemenology, but this is quite an interesting view on human existence and its relationship to time along with the human perspective of time.

    I wanted to get a better understanding of Torchaudio, and this helped with that.
    The code generated within this tutorial is compact and straight to the point which is a plus as well.
    There is a bit of review regarding the Pytorch aspects for training, testing, and predicting, but things like how to process audio prior to loading for training was quite informative.
    The example used here is that of classification of audio. This is good for educational purposes, but I think I would have preferred something more like audio generation as an example instead.

  explanation: > 
    A run through how to make a chat bot using Pytorch and NLP techniques.
    Much of this felt like review to me, but it was interesting to see how the different pieces fit together.
    To put things simply, this is an intent based conversational agent that tokenizes sentences and then constructs a bag of words representation which is used as training.
    Any sentences passed by the user is then used to determine what response to provide by determining the intent using a probabilistic threshold which makes it a classification problem.
    The model used is a simple feed forward network and there was some coverage on how to create a GUI for the project by using tkinter.
    I'd like to try building something similar myself and pair it with a torchaudio model to enable text to speech and possibly speech to text for spoken conversation.

  explanation: > 
    I needed a refresher on Pytorch as well as a full overview of the parts that I have not used in projects in the past.
    This covers the basics needed for the training and testing loops.
    It does not cover stuff like torchvision or torchaudio which can be disappointing, but since this is a beginner course, I suppose that is fine.
    It should be noted that more complex architectures like transformers, autoencoders, deep q learning for reinforcement learning and GANs are not covered either.
    There is coverage of pretty much everything for training from data loaders to optimizers, to learning rate scheduling to Pytorch lightning.
    Pytorch lightning in particular seems quite useful and since I hate dealing with boilerplate, it might be something I would be interested in using myself.
    Overall, useful for jogging one's memory, but I think the best way to really address one's weaknesses is by writing code and running it on collab.
    In my case, the parts that I find to be most troublesome is dealing with tensor shapes and formatting data accordingly for loading data and running predictions.

  explanation: > 
    Quick explanation of what NginX is. Put simply, it is a server that is used for load balancing and can be used as a reverse proxy.
    With regards to what a reverse proxy is, the differences between a proxy and a reverse proxy are not all that distinctive.
    In a reverse proxy the client doesn't know which server it is connecting to (balancer). In a proxy the server doesn't know which client it is connecting from (VPN).
    So, you can have both.

    This is a book that gets brought up frequently in online discussions, so I went into this blind to figure out what all the fuss is about.
    This focuses on free speech and how social trends are leading to a larger populace of people who are more easily offended.
    Given the topic, it raises interesting points on education, personal development, and discourse in a non-partisan way.
    What this book argues for is quite simply to avoid conflict, to assume no ill will when the intents of others are unknown, and to expose oneself to the challenges that one may realistically face rather than avoid them.
    That sentence by itself should be enough, but it manages to take the core premise and turn it into a book when an article may be sufficient.
    I appreciated the use of cognitive behavioral theory due to my own use of it in my research, but also found that this book relies too heavily on it and even simplifies it a bit more than I would prefer.
    Overall, I found this thought provoking  despite its flaws.

    I recommend reading this instead of Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People.

    The teachings here are informed by Buddhism and seem reasonable unlike some other books which makes it superior to many of the works in the same category.

  explanation: > 
    I am mixed about how much I enjoyed this year's world final, but what I am clear on is that this is one of the most interesting and most meta world finals.
    The camera work was mediocre and the music was probably the most problematic and disappointing part with beat drops and the like being fewer in number and many tracks sounding like simple drum beats on a loop.
    I agreed with most of the judging with Shigekix and Flea Rock being one that I somewhat disagreed with.
    With this world final, we have the first and youngest winner from the U.S. for the bgirls, and for the bboys, we have the first winner from Kazhakhstan and the first winner from the last chance cypher.
    This year seemed to have style clashes as well as clashes with regards to the philosophy by which competitors express themselves which was further exaggerated by the presence of Flea Rock and Nadia.
    There is a clear emphasis given to style, expression and clarity when all else is equal which is quite interesting because in previous finals, physical capabilities and execution made a larger difference.
    In a sense, this is something of a paradigm shift similar to what 2014 was where the previous generation was supplanted by the next and shows that anyone can win the belt.

  explanation: >
    I am quite impressed with this surreal epic and its performance makes me more hopeful for the future of blockbuster cinema.
    I read Dune when I was in middle school and luckily, the only thing I remembered about it was how strange it was.
    This is a story that has deep lore and the way in which exposition is interleaved with visual elements is masterful to the point that I did not even notice it.
    Cinematography and most aspects of the craftsmanship were impeccable.
    Even clothing and costumes were quite thought out and I could trace some of the inspirations.
    Music by Hans Zimmer felt like a cross between Peter Gabriel in The Last Temptation of Christ and A.R. Rahman in Bombay and had a sense of spirituality mixed into its tonality.
    I was not a fan of the heavy use of cgi and would have preferred more practical effects if possible despite the cgi being quite high in quality.
    With regards to acting, there is an ensemble cast of experienced actors who are all accomplished in their own right.
    The primary problems that might be found with this film relate to pacing and what I believe to be insufficient focus on the philosophical and spiritual musings.
    That said, I feel that anyone who could successfully work with this source material and turn a homogenous desert into something more is ranked quite high in my book.
    Overall, quite good in IMAX and now that we have all this build up, part two should have the expected payoff which I am looking forward to.

  explanation: >
    The first entry in the three colors trilogy.
    This is great. Cinematography is on point, music is thought out, and everything is deliberate.
    The closest thing I can think of are the works of Wong Kar-wai, but where Kar-Wai's works can be more dreamlike, this feels more carefully calculated.
    Krzysztof Kieslowski knew exactly what he was doing in every scene.
    This film was meant to cover the color blue and its meaning in the French flag which implied liberty.
    While Kieslowski covers liberty in a more emotional sense, this decision was a shrewd move from a dramatic perspective as it can allow for exploration of character motivations
    The process of grieving along with liberation from emotional chains was handled well with subtlety, and Juliette Binoche as the main character carries much of the film on her shoulders without any misteps.

    This is less like a film and more like a play with advanced staging.

    I feel like Voltaire would either be fun at parties or a spoilsport.
    There is no middle ground.

    Voltaire tries to dismantle and criticize everything.
    He comments on the enlightenment, philosophy, intellectualism, aristocracy, war, wealth and does all of this while his characters travel the world.
    For a short read, it still feels like Voltaire could have been more straight to the point when satirizing everything.
    In that sense, it feels similar to Gulliver's Travels.

    I need to learn how to use OpenCV for computer vision purposes.
    This covered OpenCV from basic image manipulation to recognition using existing libraries.
    The video lasted four hours, but I think most of it was worth the time due to video being a good medium to learn about computer vision.
    Different concepts are split up by chapter within the video making it easy to follow and learn what you specifically want to learn.
    The last lesson may be considered a waste of time due to it going through the deep learning pipeline and utilizing a library developed by the author of the video.
    It is very much a case of the video creator peddling his own goods which would be fine if his libraries were used by many, but that is not the case.

    The way in which ATLAS can immediately be set up with AWS, Azure or whatever is an extra plus which takes some of the complexity of devops out of the equation.

  explanation: > 
    Covers the basics of React in 30 minutes and does nothing else. This covers a todo list example in particular.
    There is no routing, there is no coverage of single binding and double binding, no CRUD's, and I think most people would be lost if they did not have prior experience with some of the technologies involved.
    While I did understand what was going on, there were some things people won't pick up on such as how binding in React works due to it not being covered explicitly.
    This also did not cover things like best practices. This only covers the main mechanics. I recommend a more in depth overview regardless of whether you are an experienced front end dev or a newcomer.
    What is also not clear is the advantages over Angular, although at face value, React seems easier to pick up.

  explanation: >
    I went into this completely blind without knowing what it was about and came out of it satisfied despite it being a young adult novel.
    This reads very easily and is quite accessible without expecting the reader to understand much about the subject matter of transgender people.
    There are themes here that are relatable outside of the particular intended scope of the novel such as loneliness, depression, and identity which can be said to be universal concerns.
    With regards to the transgender side of things, the author acknowledges that certain aspects of the experience has been excluded to make it easier for readers to digest.
    This can hurt the impact, because details can make scenes more vivid.
    In addition to that, the main character does not appear to have a recognizable personality outside of her transgender experience which is unfortunate.
    Other characters can be quite cliche at times as well with common tropes making an appearance multiple times.
    That said, the happy ending, while unrealistic, does make for a satisfying story that can be used to fill in time without much regret.

    Despite this being fairly predictable, I thought it was an entertaining satire of modern martial arts.

  explanation: >
    I don't think I have ever seen a film about marketing or advertising.
    The closest thing I can think of is Argo or The Post, but those are completely different.
    The way in which this is filmed brings the viewer back to the time during the No campaign which helped to oust Pinochet in Chile and it feels as though you are watching history.
    In terms of contents, what makes this novel is the perspective given of the Chilean people, their politics, and the propaganda side of things.
    Everything else is played rather straight with a realistic portrayal of events and the style of filming used.
    It would have been nice to have been given a look at other aspects of the campaign against Pinochet, but as a film, its focus on the television campaign manages to create a compelling narrative.

  explanation: >
    What an experience.
    This is a film on the level of Akira or 2001: A Space Odyssey that transcends its own genre by even including non animated scenes of real people.
    This is sexual, grand, psychological, and philosophical to the point that the second half feels more German than Japanese.
    In the series, the final two episodes show internal struggles during the acquisition of human instrumentality and this film shows the external aspects of the process which makes it more grounded.
    While the reflection on life and suicide is not at the level of Camus' works in terms of explicit reasoning, this manages to create a deep analysis of the degeneration of ego, escapism, depression, individuality, collective conciousness, isolation, identity, and suicide.
    The theological aspects such as Jewish Kaballah are woven into the imagery and are quite thought provoking.
    In this, humans kill God, create God, become God, and reject God.
    I don't know much of what to make of the ending.
    It is not exactly sad or happy in an obvious way.
    It is rather a deconstruction of traditional story telling and is quite ambitious at that.
    I don't know if it is tragic, cathartic, or none of the above.
    There is closure in a vague sense and a demand for interpretation created by unapologetic ambiguity.
    In that sense, it is quite representative of life and reality.

    Prior to Manifold Garden, this was the non-euclidean game to play.
    I tried playing this once and failed to complete it about five years ago.
    The non-euclidean aspects are a bit underutilized with the majority of the mechanics being related to manipulation of blocks.
    Progression involves a high amount of exploration with quite a bit of trial and error which effectively trains the player in critical thinking.
    Unlike Manifold Garden, it does not seem as though there is a lore or backstory which makes it quite a bit more minimalistic in comparison.
    Soundtrack is primarily ambient.
    I wish there were some themes or purpose woven into the greater world of the game, but it is quite a unique puzzle game that challenges the player and teaches them in a way that causes growth in players who manage to practice a certain level of patience.

    I only watched the Death portion to prepare myself for End of Evangelion.
    Did this manage to jog my memory? Yes.
    Would I recommend this to others who have have not watched the series? Absolutely not.
    This made me remember that even though I did watch the series, I did not understand it at the time due to the fact that this story is like an iceberg with much of the context hidden under the surface.
    What this manages to do well, however, is give a decent overview of the psychological backgrounds of each of the main characters which is what seems to matter.
    Since Evangelion devolves/evolves from mecha and action based scifi to that of a dive into psychological despair and the flaws of humanity brought upon by free will, I doubt that my understanding will improve without outside reading.
    General plot is somewhat clarified here with with the inclusion of a string quartet composed of the main characters, and the general outline of the human instrumentality project is clearer to me now.
    I recommend also watching Alex Jones describe the plot of Evangelion to Joe Rogan to gain a high level understanding of the trajectory of the work.
    As a stand alone product, this is not good and it truly leverages the works that came before it to reach its high points.
    Good for the recap, but it fails to recreate the emotional rollercoaster and pacing of the series.
    On the plus side, if I decide to watch the series again, I can still watch it as though I am watching it for the first time due to this work only covering the most relevant angels/apostles.

  explanation: >
    It has been almost 10 years since I saw the Evangelion series and during that time, I had no idea that there was another ending or another series of films.
    In an attempt to recap without watching the entire series, I watched this to start.
    This transported me back to the 90's.
    Animation faithfully reproduces the scenery of Hakone, and it feels just like the original Evangelion in terms of animation and terrific sound design.
    Hideaki Anno's shot composition is truly some of the best in the industry and it translates well to live action as indicated in Shin Gojira.
    Music by Shirou Sagisu is iconic and recognizable as always, and the end credits song by Utada Hikaru was a surprise.
    In terms of story, character development is stunted in comparison to the original series, but the bibilical and psychological themes still come across due to the strong imagery.
    Since this is a recap of the first quarter of the series, this can be easily forgiven, but it would be concerning if this was the case for the rest of the rebuild tetralogy.
    The angels make for a great set of antagonists, and the way in which psychological abstractions are presented within biblical conditions seems to be unique to only a handful of works.
    Overall, quite impressive with pacing being its main problem.

    As a whole, this can be a hard read, but among the short stories presented are some of the best short stories I have ever read.
    These short stories are usually defined by a single unique idea that comes to light at a climax at the end of the story.
    This is like the literary equivalent of Escher or Dali.
    The stories begin with a dense introduction that expects readers to be cultured and well read.
    The book is split into two sections and the first section The Garden of Forking Paths, in my opinion, is far more interesting when compared to Artifices.
    There are aspects of this that I did not fully understand due to certain novels I have yet to read or a lack of familiarity with Argentina and its culture, but I feel that this is something I will definitely come back to in the future.

  explanation: >
    Continuation of 2017's Made in Abyss and just as brutal as the first season.
    This does not pull any punches.
    This could have been more successful as a series of episodes or a slightly longer movie with more content and faster pacing, but in its current state it is still quite good.
    In this film, we are shown a full conflict with Bondrewd who is one of the most interesting and unique villains I have seen recently and a great display of sociopathy within science.
    Animation is great and the music by Kevin Penkin is great as always.
    Since this is a film, the amount of world building which was a strength of the previous entry is not all there which is unfortunate.
    That said, this is a good-- maybe even great-- experience and while not quite at the level of the first season, it does not diminish the previous entry and maintains a level of consistency one might expect from the same director as Monster.

    This is a game that uses perspective as its primary mechanic to varying degrees of success.
    Small objects can become large, 3d can become 2d, and objects can be born within monochrome homogeneity.
    It is truly interesting, but due to the short nature of this game, it is not used to its full effect.
    In addition to this, there was an opportunity to do something more profound with regards to the story.
    This is a game about exploring dreams, but the background of a company using dreams for psychotherapy is not enough and I was hoping for more.
    It tries to be Portal, but unlike Portal, this is not humorous, so I am not sure what the developers intended here.
    Overall, this is a veery interesting game that is too short.

    A supposedly futuristic game where you play a private investigator who is confined to her house.

    Gameplay is repetitive and while player choice may affect outcomes, choices and their consequences are not always clear.
    In additon to this, there are some mechanics such as a hacking AI, and what the character is doing away from her computer which are underutilized or misused.
    Overall, mediocre and probably not worth the time or money unless you are fine with wasting your time on something that is just okay.

    This may be divisive due to how it has a limited amount of character development and simplistic plot structure.
    In that sense, this could be viewed as filler, but the ending as well as the presentation of transhumanistic concepts made this interesting for me.
    This goes into greater depth regarding the world building, cybernetics and the bonds between humans and synthetic lifeforms.
    In terms of progressing the main story, there was not much to be seen here, unfortunately.

  explanation: >
    A work that is the first in a trilogy.
    This has the feel of an older work from the 90's or early 2000's which is indicative of the source material it is based off of.
    The future presented in this is not quite as advanced as Blade Runner or other cyberpunk stories and it feels somewhat grounded despite some of the technological advancements coming across as a bit exaggerated.
    Action and visuals are stylized and feel like a cross between a manga and a western graphic novel.
    Pacing and plot structure needs work, but it should also be noted that this is only the first of 3.
    That said, based on what I have seen so far, this work does not stand on its own, and the world building is also lacking.
    What this does manage to do somewhat adequately was cover the effects of rape and abuse from a young age.
    How this will develop will determine the quality of the work as a whole, but on its own, this entry is mediocre.

    This entire film is a meme.
    It is quite enjoyable, but it is not Scorcese's best nor is it the best film about Wall Street.

    A short game which utilizes a time loop mechanic.
    Unlike Outer Wilds, this utilizes interaction with environments and characters to change possible outcomes.
    The twists and turns themselves are not the best, but it was entertaining while it lasted.
    Voice acting by James McAvoy, Daisy Ridley, and Willem Dafoe was well done.
    The endings were quite disappointing and the payoff was somewhat underwhelming.
    There is some sort of deeper psychological underpinning, but it is not clearly elaborated upon which weakens the psychological subtexts.

  explanation: >
    A self aware film that is probably quite divisive in nature with regards to its qualities.
    This is similar to Hiroyuki Imaishi's other works in that it is extremely stylized.
    In the case of this work, the art style is like the works of Genndy Tartakovsky on steroids.
    The animation is more reminiscent of western 2d animation than Japanese animation in that sense.
    Story is threadbare with the writers literally saying that they are making things up as they go along and declaring a deus ex machina within what I assume is the third act.
    This is a film that requires a high suspension of disbelief and an ability to keep up with its spastic pacing.
    That said, for fans of studio Trigger, this is a highly indulgent film that offers a lot of self referential nods to previous works by the studio that are in my opinion far superior.

    Lex Fridman's commentary on the Tesla AI Day is actually far more insightful than that of journalists due to the way in which he does into detail regarding the neural architecture and machine learning pipeline.

    Said to be one of the greatest movies ever made.
    While I would not necessarily place it on the same level as Citizen Kane or Vertigo, I do agree that it is quite close.
    This is supposedly a film about a bicycle, but there is much more going on beneath the surface.
    At the same time, this is a film about postwar Italian society, relationship between father and son, and adversity.
    There are no special effects, camera movement is simple but effective, and we can only depend on the acting of those involved to sell the story.
    The way in which it is structured is quite well done-- particularly with the ending of the film.

    Simple and innovative.
    A great work that moves the medium forward.
    This game uses a webcam to detect blinks and the blinking of the player controls the progression of the game.
    The story is simple, but handled terrifically and touches upon the topic of life, meaning, and mortality.
    It has similarities to That Dragon, Cancer, but this is less tedious, more to the point, and more effective.
    The score is also well done.
    Gameplay is simple, but the use of blinks seems to have some sort of psychological effect when playing the game that affects the player in a greater manner than standard gameplay.
    There are areas where there is a challenge of not blinking which is something that I have never trained which can be challenging for some players.
    I believe that similar mechanics that utilize webcameras and computer vision to do interesting things have a lot of promise for the future of the medium.

    This has quite a bit of acclaim due to its popularity as a classic Christmas movie, and while I think it is a good film, I also cannot understand how people miss some of the obvious flaws.

    Cinematography is above average.

  explanation: >
    Wolfgang Petersen can be hit or miss, but this is a definite hit.
    Given the long runtime of this film, I had to split this up over multiple days which is probably the preferred method of viewing.
    This film feels like something that was made in the 70's with its general pacing, cinematography, and special effects which is very welcome.
    The film ranges from tedious to a rollercoaster of emotions, but it never gets boring.
    The set design makes it feel like they used an actual submarine and at times I wondered if they did.
    Since this was made before the use of widespread CGI, everything is practical which means that everything looks real.
    The German perspective combined with the claustrophobic nature of the U-Boat provide a distinctive feel that is only ever matched in part by other films.
    Overall, a triumph with a somewhat surprising ending.

  explanation: >
    I enjoyed the original Mirror's Edge, so I was looking forward to this as well.
    The decision to replace handcrafted linear levels partially with an open world was questionable, but also welcome in that it offers something to do outside of the story.
    The story's quality is questionable as well due to a substandard method of delivery and lack of character development and interactions.
    When compared to Mirror's Edge, the parkour movements felt as polished, but the combat aspects are just as weak and should have been removed.
    The setting and aesthetic is beautiful and should have been turned up to 11.
    Music and score by Solar Fields is great.
    I felt that writing as well as design of levels and the world were the primary problems, and fixing these would partially improve the game.
    An open world is wasted if it is not populated with interesting things to do which is one of the main failings of this game.
    Collectibles are nice, but have no meaning beyond gaining experience to unlock skills. Outside of that, there is no character customization.

  explanation: >
    Hypnotizing and broad in terms of the topics it explores.
    There are themes of intellectualism, love, journalism, family and many others.
    This film shows a naive version of the way things are and then deconstructs those things to show that everything is worse than it actually is.
    This is a film about images, and Federico Fellini moves cameras over scenes in deliberate fashion.
    Characters are distinctive and easy to identify with almost half of the characters being of non-Italian origin which gives this a cosmopolitan feel.
    I enjoyed this more than 8½, but I am unsure of which is the better film.
    That said, this is undoubtedly a great film and solidifies my opinion of Fellini as one of the best Italian directors.

    It is similar to Tom Sawyer, but has more going on in my opinion.
    The humor is a bit dated, but at times it can still be used to make statements about society.
    Controversy regarding this work is overblown when considering the time and location in which the story takes place.

    There have been many films about world war II, but there are fewer films about the GDR and Weimar republic which tend to be overshadowed by the war.
    This film covers the GDR and domestic surveillance and it is a home run of a film in terms of all aspects.
    This is moving, well paced, a film over two hours that is never boring.
    It is hard to believe that this is a directorial debut.
    The way in which a Stasi officer is affected by the people under his surveillance was well handled and convincing and it managed to show character development as well as the state of the GDR during the time.
    Overall, an outstanding film that is one of the best to come out of the German film industry and it is unfortunate that Ulrich Mühe passed away shortly after this film.

    This reminded me of Hugo in its adoration for film, but I consider this to be better.
    This starts off slowly, but it builds over time and ends quite well.
    The Italian used here is sometimes Sicillian, so it is not the easiest to understand.
    This movie has no violence, no special effects, no complex plot, only passion for film and the way its characters use it to live their lives.
    Cinematography is great, and it manages to capture the allure of an Italian town and the feel of an older theatre quite well.
    Attention to detail regarding projection adds to the general feel of the film.

    With this, I have completed the last decent Halo game developed by Bungie and conclude my interest in the series.
    This is an improvement upon Halo 3 in terms of presentation of story and gameplay despite it being a prequel that is missing many of the main characters from  the previous games.
    Characterization and development is lacking in comparison to previous games due to a minimalist touch which is one of the main drawbacks, but gameplay, pacing, and technical aspects are quite improved.
    The decision to have players play as a Spartan who is not Master Chief was interesting and changed the way players would approach the game.

    Roberto Benigni, for better or worse, is what makes this film.
    He was the main character, the director, and one of th writers and his personality is what drives the primary message of optimism, gratitude and beauty.
    This man brings an energy to the screen that is not matched by many and makes this film a unique experience.
    The backdrop of the holocaust brings about some mixed effects that may be a point of division for many since it is not primary focus, but rather a way in which to contextualize the aforementioned themes.
    As a result, realism and brutality of the event may not be quite at the level one might expect and the film may be conflicting in nature to some.
    This is definitely the case when compared with a film like Schindler's List which I consider to be the superior film despite it being completely different in terms of focus.

    Solid conclusion that has flaws, but ultimately does what it sets out to do.
    Gameplay is very much the same as previous entries with this feeling like a continuation of other games with improved graphics.
    Vehicle handling feels worse for some reason, however.
    Story picks up where the previous game left off, but I felt as though it was underdeveloped and could have offered a larger amount of world building and character interactions as fanservice at the very least.
    More cutscenes and more dialogue could easily fix some of the problems that I had.
    Overall, I am glad that I was able to finish the trilogy and see the conclusion to its end.
    Music is great and iconic as always.
    Although I felt that it could have been a grander ending with greater scale, it was enjoyable and had a feel similar to action movies from the 80's like Aliens.

    In this, Dustin Hoffman plays and actor who pretends to be a woman so that he could gain a female part in a soap opera.
    As the story progresses, his relationships with other characters becomes strained and affected by his choices.
    There is a statement on society, acting, and gender roles which may have been ahead of its time, or perhaps a response to second wave feminism.

    Quite bad.
    I had no idea why anything was happening.
    The previous Wonder Woman movie took the setting of World War 1 into account and played upon serious themes to create compelling arcs and characters.
    This film felt like a caricature where the setting of 1984 was more of a novelty and all the development from the previous film was thrown out the window.
    It is for this reason why this felt like 2.5 hours wasted.
    What this goes to show is that bad writing and narrative can waste a large budget and experienced actors.
    There was a Linda Carter cameo which also seemed hamfisted and should have been handled far better.
    After seeing Zack Snyder's Justice League, this felt like a definite step backwards because of bad writing and terrible directing.

    A fun and casual viewing that does not try to do too much.
    The story is not ground breaking, but it presents a standard action story with a self aware sense of humor.
    Choreography is not ground breaking either, but it was entertaining and the fast editing was not fast enough to make things feel incoherent which was a plus.
    It is nice to see Bob Odenkirk as the main character in the film and it is interesting to see Christopher Lloyd play an old man like he has for many decades.
    Overall, very enjoyable when not viewed critically.

    As a Zhang Yimou film, the first question many may have is whether this is historically accurate, and this takes fewer liberties than other Zhang Yimou films.
    The story is told in a very simple manner and is easy to follow.
    Visuals are the main attraction and are handled extremely well where many frames are quite memorable.
    The use of color in particular is quite striking.
    The location does not change and the main visual changes are in seasons and colors, but for some reason this manages to stay interesting through its runtime.
    In addition to that, the story is not a happy one.
    As a result, it has more of an effect of haunting the viewer after completion.

    As a game, this is disappointing.
    As a story, this is promising and very interesting.
    Gameplay is boring. The open world structure of the previous game has been made more linear which takes away from much of the appeal of the previous game.
    This game introduces time travel, eternal recurrence, and has an arc where the main character of Raziel sees the completion of his arc as a tragic hero in the Shakespearean sense.
    Lore is further refined and conversations on free will, good and evil, and false dichotomies continue in this work as well.
    I don't know if it is worth playing, but the story is interesting enough that at least reading up on it is worth it despite the cliffhanger.

    It appears that many of the greatest films have some sort of meta aspect to it.
    In the case of this film, this is a Hollywood film that criticizes Hollywood.
    In addition to that, it crosses across multiple genres which differentiates it from the others Billy Wilder films such as Some Like it Hot.
    At times it is a comedy, sometimes a drama, and once in a while, a horror film.
    Similar to Singing in the Rain, it also offers commentary on the move from silent films to talkies and features cameos by some famous figures such as Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton.
    Acting in this is interesting in that side characters had better performances than the main ones with the exception of Gloria Swanson who stole the show.
    Despite this being more than 70 years old, it is still engaging and should be required viewing.

  explanation: >
    In this work, Nietzsche uses a more traditional style of writing without a narrative like Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
    This covers morality, Christianity, free will, and deconstructs some of the works of previous philosophers while building his own thoughts upon the base they provide.
    The organization of this book is in similar form to Thus Spoke Zarathustra in that topics are not covered in logical steps and are instead covered in thematic steps which is quite unconventional.
    I think to understand this, emotion plays a role, so mileage will vary. I personally found Thus Spoke Zarathustra more useful.
    Since this covers similar topics, the former may be a better use of time.
    One aspect I did find useful was Nietzsche's explanation of the will to power.

    This has quite a similar feel to Kimi no Na wa.
    With regards to story, it is somewhat similar in quality, but on a technical level, it feels as though it is far superior.
    This showcases unbelievably detailed animation that is bordering on photorealism at times which is quite impressive, because I thought it was originally impossible for Makoto Shinkai to outdo himself given high levels of detail in his previous films.
    This, combined with its highly realistic depiction of Tokyo makes it very memorable.
    The focus on weather and heavy rainfall references the impact of global warming during the rainy season.
    The third act was weaker than the rest of the film, but it was enjoyable throughout.
    Although I think Kimi no Na wa was a better film, but I think I enjoyed this more due to the nostalgia it brought for me.
    Crossovers and cameos of characters from Shinkai's previous film were appreciated as well.

    Surprisingly deep lore and philosophical musings make this stand out among other entries during the time it came out.
    Questions regarding life, death, free will and good and evil make it directly related to the works of Nietzsche and maybe Dante.
    Gameplay can be repetitive, but approaches to puzzles are reminiscent of Zelda games at times.
    Given the time in which this came out, it can also feel clunky at times.
    Finishing this game can be quite difficult due to aged graphics and obscure solutions that may require a guide to be solved.
    Voice work was handled well and definitely was great considering the time of release.
    It's age holds it back, but its story makes it unique.
    It is unfortunate that it ends in a cliffhanger which requires players to experience the sequel as well.
    A remaster would help to solve many of the problems this game has.

    A Japanese version of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
    Mifune Toshirou plays the main character as is typical in many of Kurosawa's other works.
    Like many Shakespearean plays, the plot devices are the same, but this lacks the wordplay and prose for obvious reasons.
    Instead, it replaces that with cultural fixtures and strong acting.
    Since this is a work by Kurosawa, camerawork and shots are great as always.
    In addition to this, it offers something different by bringing attention to the setting as well.
    A great film, but there are better among Kurosawa's body of work.

  explanation: >
    This is a work of genius that should be considered as art.
    The utilization of simple geometry to create infinite environments that draw from a variety of styles of architecture from classical Greek to Japanese is handled extremely well.
    Use of infinite environments lead to scenes of a scale that I have never before seen in a game and give birth to fractal patterns that mimic mandala style configurations which complements eastern architectural styles in the game.
    The dynamic sound system makes it so that your actions can directly affect the music played based on the areas you are in, and Laryssa Okada's score leaves a strong impression.
    Similar to Inception, this takes M.C. Escher based ideas to the next level.
    It is clear that an understanding of physics, architecture, eastern styles of spirituality, and technical expertise was needed to develop this game.
    When taken at face value, this is a puzzle game, but in my experience, the appeal of this lies within the environments the player explores as they make their way through the game.
    It feels as though one is traveling through a stripped down manifestation of human civilization when it is freed from space, time, color, and the people that built it.
    Environments are simple in nature, but easily evoke emotions that are congruent with standing on top of a mountain, within a large temple, or in an empty metropolis.
    I have had dreams like what I saw here, but it is truly liberating to be able to explore such environments of my own free will.

  explanation: >
    The Song of Achilles builds upon the story in the Iliad and manages to add to the story in a way that is similar to The Historian.
    For those who are familiar with the Iliad, the general sequence of events does not come as a surprise, so what is impressive about this work is the way in which it manages to keep the familiar story fresh.
    In the case of this work, a greater focus is given to the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus which has not been covered all that well in the past.
    This work offers a unique perspective in that it is centered on Patroclus and his experiences.
    This dynamic is similar in nature to the dynamic seen in My Fair Concubine.
    The author makes a point in bringing the emotional ties between characters as a center focus which can be easily lost within the poetic text of the Iliad.
    This makes this work innovative and novel.

    Probably my favorite Tim Burton film.
    This manages to excel in terms of its ability to portray isolation and ostracism while also having a sense of humor.
    Johnny Depp handles the role of Edward very well despite not speaking all that often in the film.
    His ability to physically depict emotion is reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin.
    In terms of visuals, the setting is a cross between fairy tale, and a caricature of suburbia.
    Special effects are handled well.
    The combination of its different aspects increases the absurdity of the whole thing, but does not take away from the emotional underpinnings of the film.

    Violent, exaggerated, and hyperreal with highly detailed artwork that easily stands the test of time.
    In terms of story, it is in the vein of Blade Runner, but due to it being quite short, nothing of significance could be said to have been accomplished with its narrative.
    I think this could benefit from expansion due to its short length, minimalistic story, and unexplained setting.

    I don't usually watch or read things based on the premise alone, but this was an exception.
    From a critical angle, this is not particularly remarkable, but the premise of autism gives it some interesting situations.
    The struggle of participating in social and educational situations with the condition of autism can be quite educational at times.
    Similarly, the inclusion of LGBT themes were not particularly forced.
    Outside of that, the show is filled with tropes that are standard in family dramas and as a result, I cannot say that this is comparable to many of the great works I have previously watched, but this was entertaining.

    A very strange film that, when taken at face value, does not seem all that strange despite the premise.
    However, there are aspects of this that seem like very strange directorial choices.
    Camera work is unconventional, the actor who plays Kaspar Hauser was in his 40's at the time and had no acting experience.
    Similarly, the narrative structure is bizarre.
    This film does not try to make any statements regarding Kaspar Hauser and whether he is a fraud or not.

  explanation: >
    This is the first work of postmodernism that I have read and it signifies a shift towards more societal concerns within philosophical works.
    In this, the primary argument is that everything within our reality has become abstracted through societal and cultural constructs to become hyperreal to the point where everything no longer represents reality.
    This is quite relevant to our world today if one simply looks at social media, modern education, or financial institutions.
    With regards to the place of this work within the larger tapestry of philosophy, Baudrillard makes references to nihilism which I believe is correctly identified as the area that his work is a corollary of.
    While past philosophers may question existence itself, in the case of Baudrillard, even if what we perceive exists, such existence is invalidated due to the way in which increasing levels of abstraction are utilized.
    Interestingly enough, there are aspects of this work that consist of simulacra, making me wonder whether how valid the conclusions found here truly are at times.
    I am curious to see what Baudrillard would think of dataism as well as whether absurdist philosophy can complement his works.
    I am also curious to see what solutions exist as a possible resolution to the problems defined.

    For more attentive viewers, there are smaller details hidden here and there, but it handled its noir elegantly.
    In addition to this, it used Bushido principles in a somewhat misguided way, but somehow it managed to work.
    The color grading is saturated and dark and complments the characters and themes very well.

  explanation: >
    This 6 hour long album is a deep dive into a recreation of the first 6 stages of dementia and is quite ambitious in nature.
    I listened to each stage on a separate day and the increasing levels of modulation and modification of the original tracks in the first stage along with the passage of time successfully made it more and more difficult to tell what the original samples were.
    The more interesting progressions begin to occur from the 3rd to 6th stages where music can be disorienting and the semblance of a time signature, key or any other conventions are becomming increasingly difficult to determine due to the aleotoric nature of the music.
    In my opinion, instances of neural retrogenesis in stage 5 as well as terminal lucidity within stage 6 were probably the most interesting.
    What is quite clear is that by modifying the music, the sense of time becomes lost along with the identity of the work which translates well to the parallel of dementia, but it should be noted that other forms of neural degeneration can have similar effects.
    I recommend listening to this with no visual or other sensory simulation to increase the effects.
    The Caretaker's work has shown a deep understanding of music production, dementia, and simply a large amount of research that managed to successfully capture some of the existential concerns inherent in dementia.

    This is a great film that felt very real.
    The way in which it depicted events and places was not only poetic, but also very easy to relate to.
    Although this is on the surface about being black and being gay, it is more about understanding one's identity and growing up in hard conditions.
    This shows the flaws in all people, and at the same time, there are instances that offer moments of lucidity.
    The film is split into 3 moments in time, and all actors of all ages delivered spectacularly for their roles.
    Themes and ideas are presented subtly and with grace which is quite difficult to do.
    The ending hits hard and is incredibly relatable.

    I remember when this was a highly rated and ambitious mobile game.
    That said, many years have passed since the first episode was released for mobile, and the novelty is not quite the same on another platform.
    Story is cryptic, but not in a good way.
    It is similar to many dystopian stories, but the way in which information is presented indirectly makes it difficult to make out a coherent story at times.
    Topics regarding clones used as hard drives by storing information within DNA does not make logistical sense for anyone who is familiar with DNA based computers.
    Characters are supported by a good voice cast, but the writing is lacking.
    Gameplay is reminiscent of metal gear solid, but has a twist where you don't play the protagonist and instead are forced to watch through cameras in a manner that is similar to Observation.
    This can be fun, but repetitive milestones and tasks with limited variation makes it so that the engagement does not last until the end.

  explanation: >
    I had some prior experience with Goethe due to my familiarity with his theory of colors, but I have only just now began exploring what is considered his greatest work.
    I did not like part 1 of Faust. It felt far too similar to The Picture of Dorian Gray, and the conversations between Faust and Mephistopheles were probably the only thing about the first part that I found to be interesting.
    It should also be noted that I was not a fan of many works of Gothic literature which is also why I most likely did not enjoy part 1 despite it being a more personal experience for doctor Faust and his pursuit for knowledge and purpose.
    The second part seems to aim higher and become far more ambitious with a more classical approach to the plot with elements of Greek literature and mythology making an appearance.
    It is this part where I began to see the value of the work and why it was considered one of the best works of German literature.
    That said, it is hard to determine how well this can translate to the stage by simply reading it, because there are parts of this work that can get quite abstract at times.
    It should be noted that there are instances of humor in this work to even things out.
    In addition to this, there are figures who make an appearance who are not from Greek mythology or Christianity who I can only assume are from a German mythos.
    Overall, I don't know what to make of it as a whole, but I can see tremendous value in certain parts of this work.

    Paul Verhoeven generally had a downward trend in the quality of his films over time, but this one is one of the better ones despite it being quite flawed.
    This is unique in that it has a female perspective of the second world war from the Dutch side, but it is also quite indulgent and hits some of the same notes as Soldaat van Oranje which makes it feel derivative in many ways.
    There are aspects of this that have been handled better by Paul Verhoeven's previous works, the works of Steven Speilberg, and many other films that have been released prior to this one.
    The positives lie within the story and the acting, but if there was a point to this film or primary message, it is a bit unclear.
    The organization of events, pacing, and transitions are quite messy which is what prevents it from being on the level of films by the aforementioned directors.
    The depiction of postwar attrocities was well done, but do suffer from the flaws previously mentioned.
    As far as Dutch films are concerned, this seems to be one of the better ones, but it should be noted that the film output of the Netherlands does not quite compare with the film industries of other larger countries which means that there is not much competition domestically.
    Overall, good but lacking.

    For a Dutch film, this felt more like a French film due to that being the primary language spoken.
    In terms of genre, I could not figure out if this was a thriller, a horror film, or a psychological film and it is similar to Psycho in that sense.
    In terms of suspense, this is Hitchcockian in that it shows who committed the crime from the very beginning and instead of trying to determine who did it, we try to understand why and how.
    The sociopathic tendencies made the main antagonist almost relatable at times due to the smartly written script.
    We care less about what happened and try instead to understand what motivates the characters and that is what makes this film engaging and great.

    A greatly constructed analysis of the human condition based on a novel by Abe Koubou.
    This is well shot and the focus on sand as a source of suffering is very new to me.
    I have seen humanity's fight with the sea, with the frigid cold, and the heat, but never sand, and that made this feel very different from many other films.
    The premise is quite simple where one much dig sand out of a pit that is continuously filling with sand everyday.
    This has been stated to have some similarity to The Myth of Sisyphus, but the enjoyment of the moment as is stated in absurdism is very limited in this context and is only ever indicated towards the end of the film.
    This seems to be its own original study in eternal labor and that makes it a film to be studied.

    This game and its DLC are quite basic in its execution, but ambitious in concept.
    The story is a combination of Biblical myth, AI, and simulation theory.
    It tries to tackle and question things such as free will, consciousness and truth within the context of a god.
    Gameplay is composed of exploring a world composed of puzzles which makes it similar to The Witness.
    The puzzles themselves involve exploration of 3d space and taking advantage of simple mechanics that can be used to manipulate the environment like Portal.
    Puzzles themselves are quite challenging and build upon themselves quite effectively.
    The way in which the story and concepts are delivered are highly minimalist which leaves much to be desired especially when compared with a game like Soma, but it at least provides the bare minimum.

  explanation: >
    So, this is apparently related to the horse that caused Nietzsche to have a mental breakdown in the city of Turin.
    That said, the connection is not all that clear because we never see the aforementioned scene and this seems closer to something like Eraserhead with its feelings of emptiness.
    This is a slow film that breaks conventions in film and simply follows a simple life of endless hardship and boredom.
    Béla Tarr provides a genius film that focuses on the minutia of a simple and hard life that consists of eating boiled potatoes and dealing with an endless storm that snuffs out hope in the middle of a degenerating society that we never see in full.
    The film plays with light, subject and movement with perfect cinematography and the way in which light is snuffed out towards the end makes it truly unique and audacious.

    I enjoyed this very much and found it to either match or exceed the previous season's performance.
    The appeal and flaws of the previous season remains and new inventions of human civilization are leveraged as plot devices.
    In this season, steam power, gun powder, nitroglycerin, vacuum tubes, hydroelectrically powered devices, refrigeration, and cellular communication make an appearance this time in anachronistic fashion.

  explanation: >
    I like to think of this as a general explanation of existentialism that is intended as a type of primer while also making a few personal statements on the matter.
    Basically, the partially novel part of this work is that Sartre states that life is meaningless unless you give it meaning and that life is what you make of it.
    There are certain things that are out of our control, but what is within our control are our own actions.
    This is why existentialism can be considered to be humanism.
    This is what I consider to be of interest, but I have also seen this in other works as tangential topics, so this did not come as a large surprise.

  explanation: >
    It is my opinion that the essay format is far more effective for philosophical ponderings and such was the case for this essay.
    In the case of Peter Wessel's work, he states that the human intellect is overdeveloped for the purpose of sustaining a life.
    Zapffe talks about anchoring such as the choosing of a goal which is a way to temporarily forget about the abject meaninglessness of reality.
    In that sense, many of the things society advocates, be it love, a profession, or family, are more of distractions to delude oneself into thinking that life has greater meaning if it has meaning at all.
    Quite well done for its short length with the only criticism being that it lacks empirical backing with regards to human emotion.
    One thing I notice in many of the nihilistic works I have come across is that the majority seem to depend on certain concepts as axioms that may not even exist such as meaning, cause and effect, and time.
    In that sense, they don't go as far as they can with regards to pushing the philosophy to its absolute limit.

  explanation: >
    The version I read contained sufferings of the world, emptiness of existence and vanity of existence.
    This is a comprehensive overview of suffering and misery and I feel as though it should be a required prerequisite prior to reading any Buddhist texts or Nietzsche.
    Schopenhauer is the most realistic philosopher I have had the pleasure of reading that correctly identifies pain and suffering as a primary driver of human existence which is an intermediary step in a larger process.
    He also acts as a primer for ascetic practices and in many ways retreads the same ground as mystics thousands of years prior, but unlike those individuals, Schopenhauer manages to outline his arguments eloquently.
    Although Schopenhauer does not recommend ascetism, he does seem to follow a more Epicurean prescription whereby pain is minimized during life.
    Whether such approaches are truly successful are questionable, but since On the Suffering of the World focuses on the suffering rather than the potential cure, Schopenhauer manages to sidestep the problem of explaining the answer to suffering within this work at least.

    This is a short analysis of faith through the story of Abraham.
    There is a contemplation of the anxiety or fear Abraham had prior to his attempted sacrifice of Isaac and he then extrapolates this to human life in general.
    This is supposed to be an answer to Hegel's work, but since I did not read Hegel's work because I am not a masochist or particularly interested in Christian theology at the moment, this was not quite as rewarding as other works.
    In many cases, the concepts provided here felt quite basic and self-explanatory with many of the lessons in ethics and life seeming to be a repeat of other, more modern, works that I have read previously except those works did not have theological aspects found in this work.

  explanation: >
    This is probably the most difficult philosophical work I have read and it often reads more like a mathematics textbook rather than a work of philosophy.
    Those with prior mathematical knowledge of predicate logic and probability theory may already find some of the concepts such as a priori and a posteriori as well as syllogisms, paralogisms, tautologies, and antimonies to be familiar.
    This work introduces concepts such as transcendental idealism, schematisms, Kantian manifolds and noumenons which are a staple of Kantian philosophy and builds upon those concepts with succeeding complexity to approach many areas of study.
    It builds off of the work of previous philosophers such as Hume, Leibniz, and Descartes.
    Kant's work can be simply summarized as a critique and analysis of empirical thought, science, and intuitions due to the limitation of human perception.
    Kant analyzes what makes a concept, what is needed for something to be recognized as a thing or object.
    This is a work that is quite significant because it calls into question the existence of time, space, cause and effect, what is required to prove an omniscient and omnipotent creator, as well as how our understanding may truly be a description of our perception rather than our reality.
    This later aspect is why Kant considers this work to be his epistemological Copernican revolution.

  explanation: > 
    An overview of entropy presented in collaboration with Sean Carroll.
    I don't like the presentation style of Sean Carroll, but since this is only a 15 minute playlist, I consider it to be acceptable.
    This covers concepts like complexity, cause and effect, and the use of entropy to deduct a meaning of life.
    While this does take initial steps towards using entropy to answer philosophical questions, the lack of an explanation with regards to how entropy affects perceptions of utility, morals, and meaning as well, whether time exists or not, as well as physical manifestations of the central value theorem made this somewhat disappointing.
    Simply put, a Kantian perspective on the matter can be used to easily poke holes in what was presented which is why additional steps must be taken to fill in the holes offered by this playlist.
    Next steps would include learning information theory and chaos theory.

    The final film in a long series of films to conclude a continuity that was started by The Flashpoint Paradox 7 years prior.
    This is a surprisingly good film because it manages to sidestep problems like character development by simply standing on top of the previous works to provide something that is coherent and satisfying.
    With regards to the story, it is not particularly novel and it is predictable to a point, but the way in which heroes that were the main characters of previous installments were dropping like flies gave it some weight.

    A continuation of the story in The Death of Superman.

    This is a film that is very Japanese.
    It feels old, new and timeless all at the same time.
    The setting is that of traditional family relations that center around aging parents.
    Camera work is higly minimal with movement being entirely absent in most scenes which is apparently unique to Yasujiro Ozu's films.
    The story is quite standard, but it ends up offering a more profound commentary on human relations and society during the time in which the story took place which was years right after World War II.
    From a historical perspective, this can be educational, because Tokyo back in the 50's is completely different from Tokyo today.
    When compared with other great Japanese films like Ikiru for example, this does share a number of similarities, but in comparison, this is far slower in pacing which makes it different from the Kurosawa films.
    Overall, quite great and among the best when it comes to older Japanese films.

    While I prefer Sergio Leone's works, this is a great stylistic western that is just as iconic as Leone's works.
    The use of anti-heroes as the main characters made this quite unique where all of the characters had some sort of flaw.
    This is a violent movie during a time in which violence was not quite as common within film and the way in which it was unapologetic about was quite interesting.

  explanation: >
    Due to the time in which this was published as well as Schmitt's role in the Nazi party, his works have only recently been given serious treatment from the academic community.
    Similar to The Allegory of the Cave, while this is a work in political theory, I found the existential implications far more fascinating.
    Schmitt deconstructs politics and frames it as a distinction between friend and enemy similar to how economics is a distinction between utility and valueless constructs.
    It also highlights the downsides of liberalism by framing it as a naive oversimplification that ignores human nature.
    The most important themes that I found to be interesting were that of proper identification of friend and enemy, that the lack of an enemy will result in friends becoming enemies, that reality is inherently hostile, and that the pressure of survival is a key part of human nature.
    This not only tries to touch upon a key aspect of human nature, but also manages to describe accurately the policies of many modern governments today.
    In particular, I found this to be a useful tool to analyze the United States' military industrial complex and its purpose.
    Schmitt is also one of the only individuals of his time that considers the nature of the political to change based on technology and he seems to get close, but never reaches the concept of countries and nations becoming obsolete.

    This has high production value, and the animation work is well done.
    The story is as described in the light novel for beter and for worse, so there is not much to be said there other than that this manages to innovate in the isekai genre with its detailed lore, but is weaker with some of its character flaws which fall into standard tropes within the medium.

  explanation: >
    An introduction and argument towards the acceptance of absurdism.
    Absurdism in this case refers to that which is beyond the realms of rationality.
    Camus takes a journey through the history of philosophy before finally arriving at his using of Sisyphus to make the point that a life of torment is that of happiness due to the struggle involved.
    Camus states that absurdism is a step beyond nihilism where absurdity is close in meaning to meaninglessness.
    Accepting this meaninglessness is what Camus states is the antithesis of physical or philosophical suicide which is a statement of an inability to accept the the absurd nature of our reality.
    Instead Camus states that an act of metaphysical rebellion against death is a way to optimize life.
    This last statement is what makes this work valueable an an interesting area of study as it directly contradicts the works of many notable philosophers.

    I enjoyed this, but this is a flawed work.
    For a game that is linear and consists of cutscenes, I am surprised at how computationally heavy it was for some strange reason.
    In terms of story, I consider it to be quite well handled with pacing being the best strength.
    In the story here, it retreads familiar ground as The Dark Knight, but it focuses more on Bruce Wayne and functions like an origin story that manages to do something other origin stories have not.
    In that sense, the more story based focus which is a centerpiece of many Telltale games allows for greater exploration of inner motivations which was quite good.
    The main problems here is that of the gameplay which is quite problematic due to the fact that this is a game first and foremost.
    Mechanics involve quicktime events, simplistic puzzles, and choices that do not truly affect the story all that significantly.
    Compared to other Telltale games like The Wolf Among Us or Borderlands, I consider this to be inferior, but I did enjoy it at least.

  explanation: >
    Ambitious, contradictory, and perhaps timeless.
    This is a work that tries to do many things and retreads familiar ground, but takes a more modern approach with interesting results.
    At face value, this feels like a combination of themes that can be seen within Christianity and Buddhism, but in many cases, this is a rejection of Christrian themes.
    Nietzsche focuses on reaching the state of the overman where one transcends their humanity to become something greater which is similar to that of enlightenment in Buddhism.
    Similar to Buddhism, Nietzsche recognizes the suffering in the world and the value in overcoming.
    That said, Nietzsche takes a more beligerent approach that values laughter in place of the eightfold path.
    There is also a strange focus on the negative aspects of women which did not age well.
    The way in which it presents its ideas is with a narrative structure which I found to be quite effective, but the journey that Zarathustra or Zoroaster takes seems quite meandering and preachy.
    This is why, although I have a positive opinion of the work with regards to the individual commentaries that it makes, I am mixed regarding the larger overarching theme.
    In that sense, it truly is a book for everyone and a book for no one.

    Average and unremarkable.
    Although this focuses mainly on the Doomsday fight with Superman, there is limited character development, and the world does not feel fleshed out.
    Pacing is also inconsistent.

    A fun ride that is very much in the spirit of other action films during the time like The Magnificent Seven.
    All characters are memorable, all actors play their parts well, and the way in which the escape from the Nazi prison camp was paced kept it engaging throughout.
    The writers made a smart decision by not only showing the escape, but also the aftermath in the final act which brings the story to a larger more cosmopolitan scale.
    This is also old enough that the movie actually has a score where the theme is memorable which is quite rare nowadays.
    This is a classic that should be required viewing.

    This shares many similarities to Kimetsu no Yaiba, but I enjoyed this far more, because it seemed to cater more to my interests.
    Stylistically, it felt modern, but it also had similarities in style to older shounen stories like Bleach, and Hunter x Hunter.
    Unlike those previous entries, this had extremely high quality animation that made it feel like Fate/Zero at times.
    In the case of this work, the animation is so well done that the episodic format of the story can work against its best aspects at times and drag down the pacing from time to time.
    Sound design is also great with the modern score not taking away from the other aspects of the work.
    With regards to the story, it is standard and not particularly ambitious, but the use of curses that are generated by the accumulation of negative human emotions allows for commentary on human nature to be made.
    That said, it does not get as philosophical as it can be, but if taken purely at face value, it makes for an enjoyable ride.

  explanation: >
    This is an anti-war novel that inspired a Metallica song as well as lead to the creation of a film in the 1970's.
    Despite these other mediums being considered, I feel that only a novel can truly emulate the sensory deprivation and isolation described in the novel.
    The novel is told entirely from the perspective of Joe Bonham who cannot see, hear, smell, or taste due to injuries that took away his major senses, his limbs, his face, and his ability to speak.
    This was a smart move on Trumbo's part because it creates an element of suspense and maintains a certain level of mystery that is seen throughout the novel.
    While the focus of this novel is regarding the implications of war, I was more fascinated with some of the philosophical aspects of it.
    Specifically, I was quite interested in the egocentric predicament and the basis of reasoning which I will explore in the near future when I read one of Immanuel Kant's works.
    Overall, this is one of the better novels that I have read recently and it has a visceral impact that very few novels have.

  explanation: >
    Fast paced, sharply edited, and well acted.
    There were no weak links in this movie about real estate salesmen.
    The story is simple, and there are no bells or whistles, just pure acting and writing that keeps you engaged from beginning to end with its intense dialogue.
    From the moment Alec Baldwin opened his mouth to the end, it was a film that never stopped.
    Jack Lemmon's performance in particular showcased a range of motions from desperation to triumph.
    While it does not take full advantage of the medium of film, it works as a great drama.

  explanation: >
    Quite good albeit somewhat unrealistic story of love that lasts for decades.
    It's first half was strong with the second half being a bit weaker.
    In terms of narrative trajectories, this felt like a cross between Before Sunrise and Lost in Translation, but when compared to the two, this felt quite a bit more minimalistic.
    The largest difference is that this is less philosophical, involves less talking, and more retrospection where all characters have more of a backstory.
    This is quite accessible, slow, and very well shot with cinematography and music being one of its better aspects.
    Music is simple but effective, and dialogue is also straightforward.
    The use of flashbacks in some films is not handled very well in terms of pacing, but in this film, it works.
    There are aspects of this film that come across as stalking in a western context and take away from the positive aspects, but other than that, since this film does not try to do anything too ambitious, it does not make many mistakes.

  explanation: >
    Dense, fascinating, boring, visionary, and wrong all at the same time.
    This manages to explain the foundations of reasoning as explained by pre-Socratic philosophers and Aristotle himself.
    He manages to reduce all non-tangible items to first principles, monads, and forms.
    At the same time, he brings non-rational concepts into the conversation such as essences, will, and goodness which have no empirical basis.
    This is a mixed work, but also a work to be studied due to how esoteric it is.
    One thing that surprised me was how concepts like Newton's first law of motion and functional programming were being discussed at a basic level almost two millenia prior to when such concepts became conventional.
    Overall, it is a two-sided work that is flawed and rationally prophetic which makes it a good work to use to test or tune one's intuitions by further breaking everything down through successive gradations of abstraction.

    This is like a satire of DC comics which took inspiration from DC, Dragon Ball Z, and Akira.
    Very entertaining and a bloody alternative to currently available fare that is easily bingeable.
    While it can be predictable at times, that does not stop it from being engaging.
    Animation is well done, but it can be obvious when the animators took shortcuts and used CGI.
    I am quite curious to see how this compares to The Boys.

  explanation: >
    Great, never boring, and always epic.
    While the story is above average and can be considered good, the tension, pacing, and sprawling landscapes in which battles take place are what make this engaging.
    For characters there is a bare minimum done in terms of development which for this film was all that was needed to make it feel complete.
    Although it is not historically accurate, at times, it does feel like the film places you right in the middle of the time in which the story takes place and details the British forces and Zulu forces quite well.
    The acting was well done, and it felt very much like a western in spirit despite the setting.
    The last act in particular was shot incredibly well with camera movement being quite mesmerizing.

  explanation: >
    I've wanted to read the work of Alfred Tennyson as well as familiarize myself with Arthurian legend, so this allowed for me to kill two birds with one stone.
    The prose is handled very well, which is to be expected of a poet and words flow from one to another beautifully in blank verse.
    Although the term idyll is used in the title, this is not idyllic, but rather tragic with the idylls starting from Arthur's rule to ending with Arthur's death and the dissolution of the round table.
    Similarly, although in popular culture, Arthurian legend focuses on things like Excalibur and the grail, the idylls included the ugly parts of the story with details of Arthur's illegitimate birth, and the presence of Christianity in every part.
    I would not say this is ground breaking, but it does provide great prose with a classic story of heroes.

  explanation: >
    A very ambient and surreal game that feels almost like a choose your own adventure book where you don't really choose anything.
    The story is convoluted and bizarrely paced albeit written with great prose.
    In fact, this felt more like a novel than a game with gameplay changing only to vary the way in which the story is told in the many acts the game presents.
    Themes of death and debt are found throughout the story.
    The soundtrack is interesting which a mix of ambience, some country songs, and a few songs that sound like something Pink Floyd would come up with.
    For a point and click style game, this was strangely engaging despite struggling to understand everything thoroughly.
    It made me want to visit some of the locations in Kentucky and also research some of the game's avant-garde influences.

  explanation: >
    Despite a new studio, a new composer, and the use of more CGI, this is a great slow burn that manages to continue the story without diminishing it.
    The story is not no longer a story of survival, but the story of a race of people.
    The use of flashbacks interspersed throughout this season was questionable, but it did not hurt the pacing.
    The story continues with the previous parallels to the Jews and Nazis during World War II, but has parallels to the Ottomans and other similar nations from World War I in addition to references to chemical and nuclear warfare.
    It is clear that this work draws from many other works such as Arthurian Legend, Metaphysics, The Old Testament, and Greek Philosophy.
    The commentary on genocide and war crimes is quite thought provoking, because it seems to convincingly try to ask the question of whether there are instances where committing human rights violations can be just.
    The story ultimately ends on a cliffhanger, and we will need to see the succeeding part to get a full answer, but overall, this is quite well thought out and difficult to predict especially when taking into account some of the existential and ethical implications.
    The growing levels of abstraction and western esotericism is truly ambitious.
    Next steps may include reading German philosophy. E.g., Immanuel Kant, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Carl Schmitt.

  explanation: >
    Cynical, well written, and well paced.
    The editing was not necessarily the best, but it was nothing out of the ordinary for the time in which the film was made.
    It operates as an effective thriller, but also offers satirical and political intrigue.
    The use of cacausian actors to play Koreans and Chinese characters was questionable.
    The psychological implications of brainwashing is interesting, and the concept of the U.S. already being compromised by foreign agents is an area of interest even today.
    Overall, this is a greatt film that aged very well despite the previous cold war being over for decades.

  explanation: >
    A very hard and dense read which is why I have decided to stop after the first volume which is in excess of 1000 pages on its own.
    This manages to offer some historical context on the effects of industrialization during the 1800's and how it resulted in reduced welfare for many due to unfair and predatory practices by employers.
    This work has the appearance of a work focusing in microeconomic effects, but it does invoke pathos to make an emotional plea against capitalistic practices which pulls it into the realm of subjective reasoning.
    That said, many of the concerns brought up in this work are concerns that are often times ignored today such as economic externalities which are imposed upon society and the greater public.
    This is a problem typically handled and regulated by governments since the externalities enter the realm of public welfare.
    Despite its relevance to the modern world, it should be noted that it is quite limited when it analyzes machinery due to a fully automated economy not being a consideration given the technology at the time.
    In addition to this, there are times when Marx oversimplifies situations or generalizes when it suits his arguments which ultimately weakens his statements.
    Overall, this is a work that manages to identify many problems brought on by industrialization, but does not offer a solution.
    Such a solution may be presented in the succeeding volumes or the manifesto written by Marx, but I've seen everything I wanted to see.

  explanation: >
    When Hollywood is incapable of delivering, the animated works of DC can sometimes be better than the live action material.
    The Dark Knight Returns, The Flashpoint Paradox, and Assault on Arkham are such examples.
    However, this is only true based on the skill of the director the quality of the source material, so DC animated works can be hit or miss.
    In this case, it is somewhat of a mixed bag.
    This work offers a look into the supernatural side of D.C. comics and although this is a Justice League type story, other than Batman, the familiar characters one might expect are rarely seen.
    Instead, we are given a look at other characters who don't get as much attention such as Constantine and Zatanna.
    This could work, but character development is limited and in a work that is less than 80 minutes long, depth is something that is lacking which hurts the story.
    If you think of this as an episode in a long running series, it could make it more tolerable, but as a stand-alone work, it leaves much to be desired.

  explanation: >
    This is a movie that operates with no logic whatsoever which can work to its advantage as long as it does not take itself too seriously.
    In many cases, it does not take itself seriously, so it works, but the majority of the film feels like a long 3 hour slog with overacting and stereotypes that don't add much to the experience.
    The writing is absolutely terrible at times, but the camerawork is great which makes for a very confusing mess because it feels like Kubrick is behind the camera, but a complete moron wrote the script.
    Overall, a very mixed bag that relies on the appeal of the 90's to create a romance film that is worse than DDLJ and did not age all that well.

  explanation: >
    The original Justice League was a bad movie. This 4 hour flim is a significantly better one.
    With regards to Zack Snyder's previous work, subtlety and nuance is not one of his strengths, but every once in a while, he makes something decent.
    This is one such film. While I would not call this great and I question the heavy use of periodically unconvincing CGI which takes away from the image, this manages to improve upon most DC films released before it.
    In this film, the mythos of the DC universe begins to be established, each character gets the respect they deserve, and most characters get their own arc.
    In many ways, it felt almost reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings due to the scale and the lore that is being offered.
    The return of Junkie XL for the soundtrack is also much appreciated.
    What we see here is a story of triumph in terms of a director's passion as well as within the film's story itself, and the universe being established is quite promising.
    For the casual filmgoer and fans, this undoubtedly makes for a satisfying experience.
    The 4:3 ratio was strange, but it makes the film really feel like something out of a DC comic which makes it a success to me at the end of the day.
    It shows a certain level of care and it offers something you cannot find in the Marvel films which makes it quite unique despite its shortcomings.

    The fourth one ended in another explosion.

    A bunch of highschool teachers try to maintain a certain blood alcohol level to improve their lives.

    This contained the Constitution, and all 27 ratified amendments including the Bill of Rights.
    Reading this now, it feels that the work was quite forward thinking in terms of how it allows for U.S. law to be dynamic in nature.
    That said, it also feels outdated in that it does not seem to consider changing technologies, human relations, and paradigms.

    The first of Ryan Coogler's collaborations with Michael B. Jordan and Ludwig Göransson.
    As a first film, this is well made and covers one of many police shootings.
    The first hour is basically build up of the characters and in the last 20 minutes, we watch a man die.
    We know exactly what will happen, but it is still engaging throughout.
    There are a few minor problems, however.
    The roles played here are not that challenging in that every character is fairly normal in nature.
    In addition to this, the camera was shaking when it did not need to be.
    Finally, if there is some sort of message, it was not the clearest and requires some background knowledge on race issues and police issues in The United States.
    That said, for a debut film, it is well done.

    Woody Allen's sharp dialogue and script are what make this a great film.
    Some of the references are dated, but this has aged relatively well and it will get a few laughs.
    While this is a story about a relationship, the conversations meander between many facets of life that may be considered mundane.
    Commentary about driving, death, relationships and antisemitism indicate the variety of topics the script visits in no particular order.
    As a result, it can be fast paced, but also meditative in a way due to the way it muses on an eclectic collection of subjects.
    Probably the best Woody Allen film I saw so far.

    This was published in the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written.
    While everything covered here can be learned in a far more efficient manner from a microeconomics and macroeconomics textbook, the historical context makes some of the content interesting.
    What is surprising about this is the level of detail by which the sophisticated networks through which money and value exchanges hands is described.
    This talks about almost every industry during the time from rent to land ownership to the financial considerations involved with slavery.
    It compares and contrasts between different countries during the time such as India (described as the east Indies), the Dutch, and the colonies in America.
    It is truly quite impressive, but it is not an easy read. It is also very rarely an enjoyable read and is quite dense.
    Although Adam Smith is said to be the father of capitalism, if the contents of his book are anything to go by, the merchant trade enjoyed capitalism or some primitive variant of it since as far back as the ancient Greeks.

  explanation: >
    Great film that reminded me of 400 Blows and Requiem for a Dream.
    This film directs its gaze towards the homeless and children living on the streets of Bombay.
    The film manages to depict the uncertainty of living on the streets from the perspective of a young boy who is trying to save up money to go back home.
    This is a movie where nothing goes right for the characters and everything ends badly.
    In that sense, it is similar to Requiem for a Dream, but this came out more than 10 years before Requiem for a Dream and has a different pacing and editing style.
    This burns more slowly, and as a result, there isn't a time when the viewer is ever feeling all that great.
    There are no clear ups in this films, which means that it is very much a slow burn of suffering.
    I have heard that this is based off of a Brazilian film called Pixote, so that may be something to watch in the future.

  explanation: >
    I have read the allegory of the cave before, but this is my first time reading Plato's Republic in full.
    While this is focused on concepts such as what is the best way to govern and rule, it makes a number of tangents to cover other grand topics.
    The exploration of these ideas is presented in the form of a Socratic dialogue where Socrates basically debates with a bunch of straw men to prove his point.
    The argumentation and reasoning is outdated, but the topics covered are still quite relevant today as they are very central to civilization and being human.
    I think if some of the arguments were stripped from their context of being used in favor of certain topics such as whether justice is good, it may have been less messy and easier to digest.
    That said, it was an interesting read, and the age of the work also implies that things are kept bare-bones in terms of narrative structure and devices.
    The only bells and whistles here are the many allegories used to prove certain points.

  explanation: >
    The prose is well written, and the content is thoughtful.
    I was not the biggest fan of this, but it does manage to do what it set out to do quite well.
    There is an underlying complexity to all the characters presented that speaks to the flexible nature of man and how he is influenced by the forces around him.
    The focus on vanity and mortality as Dorian Gray ages without physical change is well done.
    For me, I personally could not care less about Dorian Gray as I read this novel, so its impact is lessened for me.
    The way in which Dorian Gray struggles with the choices he makes is quite similar to Crime and Punishment, but the consequences and torment of questionable actions do not seem to be quite the same which is quite interesting.
    There are a number of quotable moments and takeaways, so its acclaim is understandable.

  explanation: >
    This was enjoyable, but mixed when viewed from a critical angle.
    The duo of Kamal Haasan and Madhavan is great, but underutilized.
    The buddy travel dynamic is the best part of the film, but the decision to use up almost half of the runtime on a flashback is simply a bad decision in terms of pacing and unnecessary in terms of character development.
    This may be a result of it trying to be a mass movie and a movie with an emotional hook which results in it trying to do many things at once.
    There is communism, humanism, capitalism, and other isms, which is fine, but for many of these themes, discussions are often only surface level.
    I think a general audience would not have a problem with this, but streamlining certain parts would have been pragmatic decision that would have strengthened the film as a whole.
    The main lesson of God and love are great and are delivered very well in the final act of the film.
    Overall, this is a film that has great parts, but did not live up to its potential.
    I may consider watching Planes, Trains, and Automobiles next since it apparently does something similar.

  explanation: >
    This is quite an achievement in terms of premise, gameplay, and mechanics and is comparable in quality to that of a Nintendo game despite it being an indie game stemming from a thesis project.
    I have personally been waiting for more games to use a groundhog day style mechanic in a meaningful way and this is the first work that has satisfied me.
    In addition to this, the physics which were somewhat inspired by real physics is quite welcome and adds a level of immersion when the player is forced to struggle with the controls of the spacecraft.
    The way in which different events only occur at different times within the timeloop means that there is an added level of exploration involved.
    You may have explored a planet fully, but as time passes, more may be revealed.
    Because of this, this manages to strike a good balance between exploration and exploitation while managing to weave a story that is coherent and manages to touch upon hard sci-fi themes that are often covered in Arther C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov novels.
    It may not be cinematic, but the philosophy by which it operates manages to successfully execute one of the core parts of games which is playful exploration and improvement.
    It is one of those games that manages to move the medium forward.
    If a game came out with a similar Groundhog Day mechanic with a bit of urgency and character interaction like Edge of Tomorrow, I think all bases will be covered with this type of premise.

  explanation: >
    This movie by Jean-Luc Godard is a French New Wave film with very experimental editing and camera movement for the time.
    It makes references to American film while paving its own path in its approach.
    The way it displays Paris, plays with language, and seems to mimic and subvert other crime dramas from 1940's Hollywood was quite interesting.
    The acting by the duo of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg was very well done with Belmondo's role coming across as an exaggeration of a traditional 1940's protagonist who frankly does not give a damn.
    Overall, while it may not seem remarkable in comparison to the many generations of films that came out afterwards, for its time, it feels very unique.

    This is a film with an almost meandering pace that you can get hypnotized by if you enter it with no expectations.

    Saoirse Ronan's acting as a teenager from Sacramento was quite convincing, and the often subtle humor matched the pacing quite well.
    For a coming of age story, this felt quite real and relatable.
    I'm not sure if this is one of those movies with a particularly memorable plot (especially given that this is one of those coming of age stories), but it was quite well executed while I was watching it.

    A story of Ponyboy Curtis who is from a low income group known as the Greasers in th 60's and is constantly getting into fights with a higher income group known as the Soc's.
    I have a mixed opinion of this novel despite its praise.
    While it does seem to have some similarities to Catcher in the Rye and Camus' The Stranger, this does not seem as profound.
    This is understandable because this is a young adult novel, but the general takeaways and musings seem very basic. Universal, but basic.
    Other than that, it doesn't ever feel terrible, but the way in which characters interact with each other seem unrealistic in the way a writer may embellish their prose with unnecessary details to make it flow better.

    I don't know if Katsuhiro Otomo is in semi-retirement, but I wish he would be more prolific.
    This is what I imagine is a spiritual successor to other similar works consisting of shorts that Katsuhiro Otomo worked on like Manie Manie, Memories, and Robot Carnival.
    The biggest difference between this work and its predecessors is its main theme being focused on Japan and the use of CGI which was still developing during the time of its predecessors.
    While I believe the predecessors (Memories in particular) will have a greater legacy, this was rather impressive and reminded me of the artistry involved in animation.
    The fact that one of the shorts in this was nominated for an Academy Award should speak for its quality.
    My personal favorites within this collection is that of the opening sequence by Koji Morimoto and Buki yo Saraba.
    The ending song of 夢であいましょう from the NHK variety show that ran in the 1960's was a welcome touch, but it did surprise me since I imagine it would be considered a very obscure reference for any Japanese person born after the 1970's.

    A best selling indie game from the creators of Bastion.
    This feels very similar to Bastion except the setting is slightly different and the gameplay has a more strategic approach which emphasizes experimentation.
    In terms of art and sound design, it also feels very similar to Bastion, but it has less of the dynamic narration that Bastion was famous for.
    The story feels like something that can only be described as fantastical science fiction.
    It is hard to make sense of it, because it is more fantastical than it is science despite it taking place in the future or within a simulation.
    In that sense, it is somewhat similar to TRON.
    Character development is good and bad at the same time, because I know very little about the motivations of the characters, but also because the player spends a lot of time with them.
    In terms of gameplay and content, this has quite a bit of variety and manages to keep things fresh by packing everything within a short play time.

    A very shrewdly constructed mature game that is superior to the previous entry in every way and far more streamlined.
    This is less buggy and manages to create a great balance between open world and linear design.
    In addition to this, the combat and mechanics are far better and feel fluid despite its difficulty.
    The first parts of the game has a momentum that is not shared by many games, but this game does lose that momentum over time which is somewhat unfortunate.
    The story is deliberate and shrewd to put it lightly.
    This is a game that values player choice, but the story is very messy in the sense that your choices have consequences that are realistic and can result in complex outcomes.
    Unlike traditional stories, this does not alway have satisfying results, but that is part of what makes it unique.
    If you choose to kill everyone, you get some satisfaction, but doing so can feel out of character if role playing is a priority.
    Similarly, if you decide to choose the lesser of evils like a witcher may, you may find that the climaxes are not climaxes, but rather whimpers.
    There are not many games that are willing to allow for the player to do such a thing, but this is one that is confident enough to deceive and overturn expectations.
    Great, but imperfect. I am interested in the next game which may allow for plot points to be resolved, greater variety, greater scale, and some level of resolution as hinted by the story.

    My first Greek film.
    This is a strange film that has an interesting premise, but I was not a fan of the execution.
    I imagine for most audiences, the opinions on the quality will most likely be divided.
    The premise of children who cannot leave their home is reminiscent of Peter Pan while their outlook is reminiscent of Plato's allegory of the cave.
    That said, this did not exactly focus on the existential angle and spent more of its time on the psychological and surreal.
    In that sense, it somewhat succeeds with its bleak visuals, but the lack of variety in the scenery can definitely make it feel as though it drags.
    Overall, it is thought provoking, but lacking in some aspects to make it what I would consider to be a great film.

    This was one of those films that does almost everything correctly, but also may not be all that memorable due to its lack of moments that stand out.
    Pretty much every part of this film is good, and the portrayal of 1960's America is fairly accurate.
    The historical accuracy, particularly in its depiction of LBJ, was not, but everything else felt real to the point that it was almost like a documentary which is an accomplishment to be noted.
    The main aspects that are particularly good are David Oyelowo's acting and the self control of the director to not dramatize anything and just show what is happening.
    The way in which some aspects of America have never changed make this film and its contents still relevant today.

    A good underdog story of a man trying to bring low cost air travel to India.
    It can be melodramatic at times and although they had access to real planes, they chose to use CGI instead in some scenes.
    Cinematography is decent, but the acting is probably the best aspect of this film.
    The pacing is also well handled and the film moves along without feeling slow.
    The level of detail with regards to how it describes commercial air travel and the logistics is very interesting and helped fill in some gaps in my knowledge with regards to the aerospace industry.

    A clumsy and sub-par game that has heart.
    It has lore, and quite a bit of thought placed into its world building and story telling.
    Voice acting is sub-par and the gameplay and UI is clunky.
    Much of the game is spent going back and forth between different places to complete quests which can get tedious and even frustrating if you become aware of how much time is being wasted.
    For 2007, this is also not all that graphically advanced or well optimized.
    Voice acting or localization left quite a lot to be desired.
    This reminds me of the first Mass Effect, but unlike that game, this focused more on the rpg elements.
    There are romances, but they are fairly shallow in nature.
    As a result, it was less cinematic and I enjoyed it less.
    Conversely, the story and some of the moral choices which involve choosing the lesser of two evils places players in situations that many games do not do.
    It is strange to see a game handle story well, but fail in gameplay.
    I believe the mistakes made here are easy to fix and a remake will result in a great game.
    I would be interested in the sequel or a more cinematic approach to the contents here like a film if one ever gets made.

    Another great Mani Ratnam film.
    I was expecting this to be similar to Nayakan, but unlike Nayakan, this is less of a crime drama and more of a drama in the classical sense like a Shakespearean play.
    This is not so surprising, because it seems to be somewhat based off of the story of Karna from the Mahābhārata.
    Cinematography is great as always and color grading is well done with all scenes having an orange hue to represent the sun and the main character played by Rajinikanth.
    Music is by Ilaiyaraaja, so an older sensibility is to be expected regarding the main theme.
    That said, it does have some grandeur that gives the film a feeling similar to that of a spaghetti western at times.
    Action scenes feel dated, but do not take away from the film.
    Acting and the general simplicity of the themes of family and justice were one of the greatest strengths of this film with Rajinikanth showing that he could actually act with nuance.
    This is a deliberately made film that showcases the expertise of all who were involved.

    I have bought into some of ARK Invest's financial packages and while the general philosophy behind their strategy aligns with many of my values, this is the first time I have listened to the people behind the company.
    While I am not thoroughly impressed due to a lack of rigor regardign what they consider to be "innovation", they seem to be the most knowledgeable out of most of the companies that I buy ETF's from and their definition conforms with the neoliberalist trend of growth based investment.
    They are also the only company offering packages that focus in technological advances in different industries.
    Also, like Cathie Wood, I also believe a sizeable correction will be inbound. With regards to when, I am not quite as sure, but it is unlikely that stocks will be going up forever.

    This is very different from other musicals that I have seen.
    It has the feel of a musical for a stage, but it also has the feel of a low budget indie film.
    This felt like a cross between Pink Floyd's The Wall and Spinal Tap.
    What this offers which many films don't offer is a conversation on gender and the idea of feeling whole.
    When this is combined with the unique state of music in the late 1990's and the fall of the Berlin wall, it feels like it is ahead of its time and also frozen in time at the same time.

    This is a film that blows other films in the same genre out of the water.
    The script is always filled with sharp content, and as long as you realize that everything in the movie is a caricature, the film works as a stylized comedy that does not slow down.
    Because of this, as long as you don't take it seriously, this film will deliver.
    When compared to other films like The Hangover or Superbad, this feels smarter and almost feels like it has an element of improvisation which makes it feel more genuine and better executed.
    The soundtrack is composed of mostly already established music from popular culture, but the choice of music used is appropriate.
    That said, it makes many references to politics and other sources that might make it effective today, but may affect how this film is received in the future.

    An imperfect, but fun film that is carried by the performance of Jessie Buckley who plays the lead role.
    The concept of country music being enjoyed and generated outside of the U.S. feels like common sense, but until this film, I have not considered it.
    This film is not particularly groundbreaking, and the general progression of the main character does not seem to be paced all that well, but it is able to generate drama by presenting conflicting decisions where the main character has to choose between her dreams and the worries of her current life.
    One thing that is quite interesting about this film is that it is not overly romanticized, and it shows a more realistic outlook on the music industry as a whole which worked to the benefit of the film.

    I have no idea if this is a good movie or not, but the imagery is on another level.
    In a word, it is psychedelic, and while it seems to initially be a reference to Christianity, the inclusion of tarot cards, astrology and other pseudoscientific aspects make it difficult to pin down.
    This is thoroughly original. It breaks the fourth wall, and it has sequences that are downright confusing.
    Production quality is high and on a technical level and it feel like the budget is much higher than it truly is.
    It is difficult to critically analyze this film, and I have not read any of the literature that acted as inspiration for this film.
    It is also difficult to recommend, because I think people's opinions on this will drastically differ.

    By the Roman emperor who was also a philosopher.
    I have seen the lessons mentioned here repackaged and retold in multiple ways in many other stories and self help books, so I found that I did not learn much here.
    That said, this is clear and to the point and it covers quite a lot of ground.
    Unlike more derivative works, this has very little fluff.
    While this is an overview of the stoic philosophies of Marcus Aurelius, it is not quite the same as the works of Confucius or other philosophers.
    Rather, it feels more like many musings that have been organized after the fact.
    The organization of the books means that there is no conversation between multiple parties or a narrative.
    Because of this, it is possible to read different parts at different times without losing much in terms of clarity.
    I think this work is important and the way it covers topics like perception and its relation to oneself is quite important for handling feelings of failure, pride, and entitlement.

    What this game does well is art, sound, and puzzle design.
    It tells a simple story of childhood friendship, but the story does not get more complex or detailed than that.
    The mechanics are interesting and similar to Braid in that you can reverse and speed up time to solve puzzles.
    What is different about this is that it does it in 3d and utilizes occlusion and global events to add challenge to figure out what to do.
    The two main character are always controllable through the flow of time, but other mechanics allow for some objects within levels to ignore time and move even when time is frozen.
    This makes non-linear thinking an important part of the process.
    I found the puzzles interesting. Only big flaw is that there are a number of bugs related to display and progression that can be blocking, but they are never overly frustrating.

    This isn't the type of book that you read for enjoyment.
    The contents are that of a dystopian novel that felt somewhat similar to The Giver, but this had more of an emphasis on theocracy and freedom-- specifically reproductive freedom.
    I honestly don't know what to make of the contents of this, because it feels extremely unrealistic and also somewhat dated.
    The idea of a autocratic theocracy popping up overnight in the form of a coup within the United States is not impossible, but the way in which it is described here shows a lack of research regarding government, military, and economics.
    That said, it is thought provoking and mirrors organizations that we have seen in the past as well as in other countries.
    The book even correctly cites Iran and the Phillipines as having similar constructs.
    With regards to the characters, I felt that was well done and well thought out.
    Subtlety is the name of the game in a society like the one described here, and this books manages to handle subtlety and nuance well.
    For me, it is a mixed bag, and I felt it to be slow, but I can recognize that mileage will indeed vary for different readers.
    Edit: After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol" target="_blank">2021 storming of the United States Capitol</a>, this may not be quite as unrealistic as initially stated.

    A story of the final moments in the bunker where Hitler died.
    Most of the World War II movies I have seen have excluded the German perspective, so this film which takes an unbiased look at the German side felt fresh.
    Although Hitler has committed atrocities, he was a human, and a realistic portrayal helps to provide a more educated outlook on the war as a whole.
    Bruno Ganz as Hitler is accurate. He gets inflections and small details right and performs his job well.
    The desperation on the German side towards the end of the war is made very clear in this film and the educational value of this film should not be understated.
    It is an impressive film that felt real and hits hard.

    I originally confused this with Zhang Yimou's Raise the Red Lantern due to somewhat similar topics which I plan to watch in the future.
    This is an ambitious story that is difficult to watch.
    The story is rich in Chinese culture and follows the country through the eyes of opera actors starting in the 1920's.
    In this sense, it is very similar to Bernando Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, but unlike that film, the settings are not quite as grand, this has more Chinese culture, and is completely in Mandarin.
    The topics this film tries to address are quite daring for the time. Not only does it try to display Chinese opera in detail, but it also covers the rise of different factions such as the CCP, the cultural revolution, and homosexuality.
    This is a tragic story that is quite reflective of the experiences of those who lived during the time and does not try to shy away from showing what happens if it can.
    If I were to say that I enjoyed it, I would be lying. This is not the type of movie that you enjoy. This is the type of movie that you experience and it is a great experience at that.

    A solid game with well optimized gameplay that does not have many flaws.
    The story is large in scale, but it works and can actually work as a part of the Greek mythos with some modification which is rather impressive.
    This is not filled with ridiculous amounts of content, or the greatest variety of enemies, but somehow this manages to have just enough to stay entertaining and compelling.
    Levels have enough variation, boss battles are unique, the platforming is not frustrating, puzzles are reasonable, and the camera is not that bad despite it not being controlled by the player.
    Despite this being a PS2 game, it still manages to provide a sense of scale in some of the larger levels in a way that even some modern games struggle to do.
    It is clear to see that this game pushes the PS2 to its limits even though I am able to emulate it at more than 1080p resolution with little difficulty.
    Since the story shown here is a full arc that has a satisfying conclusion, I have to wonder what point there is in playing the sequels, but I am curious to see how technical improvements over time can affect the fundamental gameplay.

    This two part film was directed by Anurag Kashyap who also directed Black Friday and is another great film.
    This is a film that has great pacing and a guerilla style of filming which made me get lost in the film in a way that I forgot about the meta aspects of the film.
    The way in which we watch generations of gangsters grow and die is hypnotizing and felt as though I was watching a piece of history with the rise and fall of different factions.
    Although this is stylized, this is never rushed and each scene has its own carefully thought out pacing which reminded me of Scorsese's Goodfellas.
    It is apt to compare this to Goodfellas and The Godfather, but it should be noted that this is trying to do something different and should be judged on its own terms.
    This film follows the development of its characters along with the development of India which makes it a masterful weaving of crime, family, country, politics, and the trends of the times.
    Definitely one of the best films of the previous decade.

    A game that has clearly had a lot of work put into its story, sound, and art, but is lacking on a technical level.
    This is unique in that it has characters from Disney and characters from Final Fantasy games (specifically FFVII, FFVIII, and FFX).
    Gameplay is clunky, and frustrating. The camera is controlled by the trigger buttons rather than one of the analog sticks.
    Platforming is tedious, combat lacks depth, and magic is a pale imitation of what can be seen in the Final Fantasy games.
    A decent number of the voice actors from Disney the movies voiced their characters here which was a pleasant surprise.
    Character models are less animated in comparison to their film counterparts, but due to this being an early PS2 game, that is to be expected.
    The inclusion of Disney worlds and settings is quite shallow with character motivations and traits from the films being excluded or only touched upon on a surface level.
    The way in which levels are set up encourage exploration which is similar to other Square games and a secret ending is provided to reward exploration.
    Music is good with remixed versions of Disney music being unremarkable, but music made specifically for the game being incredible.
    This original music elevates the work and overshadows its flaws with memorable leitmotifs.
    The story is a standard hero's journey with a fight between darkness and light, but quite endearing at times.
    I believe many of the problems in this game are a result of the time it was made in, and that future games should improve upon the flaws.

    A modern retelling of Baital Pachisi.
    I had no prior knowledge of story, so my impressions are based on the film alone.
    It is a solid neo noir story that tackles the topic of morality, and black and white.
    The editing was distracting and made shots shorter than they needed to be to artificially generate excitement.
    Outside of this, the dynamic between Vikram and Vedha was great and both roles were well acted.
    It is to the extent that all other actors ended up dragging down the film due to being outshined by Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi.
    The interactions between Vikram and Vedha are well written and feel very similar in quality to interactions between Deniro and Pacino in Heat or the interactions in The Dark Knight.
    Overall, great film with some flaws that seem to be less of a problem with the film and more a characteristic of the tastes of the demographic it caters to.

    This is Bong Joon Ho's best work and probably the best Korean film I have seen so far.
    This is a director that has consistently done good work and of the films of his that I have seen the only one I did not find all that enjoyable was The Host.
    It is a total homerun of a film that feels like a 1930's black and white film brought to the modern age.
    The symbolism and commentary on the divide between classes and the current state of late-stage capitalism is fairly obvious, but not presented in a way that comes across as preachy.
    The content is genre bending and original.
    It is a black comedy, a thriller, it has horror elements, and finally it becomes somewhat Tarantino-esque towards the end.
    The depiction of a rich family and a family of scam artists is interesting and counterintuitive.
    Surprisingly, the more educated individuals come across as the least clever which works well for the comedy, but it leads to some thought provoking discussion as to how accurate this is about the real world.

    A series that tries to converge all the different D.C. universes and realities through an epic conflict.
    Since this came out in the 80's, this is complete with many of the conventions of that time.

    In addition to this, the way in which the story was told was needlessly wordy.
    The costume designs are obviously dated.
    The physics of the multiverse is bizarre and impossible.
    Overall, it was a chore to read and not that enjoyable, but it did provide some historical perspective on some major and many minor D.C. characters.
    It was somewhat fun seeing three different versions of Superman fighting together, but because of the scale of the story being told, the multitude of characters made the story feel crowded and convoluted.

    A very enjoyable film by Wes Anderson that takes place in a caricature of a future Japan.
    The main characters which are dogs speak English, and the humans speak Japanese.
    This is a strange choice, but it makes for an interesting presentation of the exposition and dialogue.
    Animation is well done, detailed, and aesthetically unique.
    The use of Japanese and English feels awkward at times, but in a Wes Anderson film, that can actually work towards the film's advantage.
    When compared with Fantastic Mr. Fox, this is about the same and maybe slightly inferior due to Fantastic Mr. Fox's better characterization, but overall, this is a great film.

    This is imperfect and rough around the edges, but it has many merits.
    The first is that it has a good cast with notable figures such as David Bowie, Kitano Takeshi, Tom Conti and Sakamoto Ryuichi.
    The premise is that of the experience of POW's in a Japanese prison camp in Java during world war II.
    The story is unflinching and shows a somewhat realistic representation of how the Japanese treated POW's.
    This is surprising, because the director is Japanese, and typical protocol is to deny or ignore the actions of the Japanese empire during world war II.
    Although this is an English and Japanese language film, I recommend using subtitles, because the English of the Japanese actors is not the best and Tom Conti's Japanese pronounciation is imperfect.
    Music is probably the best part of the film. I would consider the score in this to be Sakamoto Ryuichi's best work and even better than his work in Bertolucci's The Last Emperor.
    The flaws of this film are that of a general awkwardness in structure and acting.
    There seems to be a difference in western and Japanese styles of acting which results in a certain dissonance.
    Camera movement is not the best, but shot composition can be great at times.
    Finally, characterization was not the best, and it is questionable who were the main characters and why certain characters had a greater focus than others.

  explanation: >
    A short story that is about the heat death of the universe.
    It involves a series of succeeding civilizations and entities asking a universal computer how to reverse the rise of entropy.
    I have no idea what a universal computer is, but if it really existed, it probably would not have any vacuum tubes and would be more sophisticated than what was described in the story.
    The story is interesting, because it tells the story of how sentient life evolves over time intervals of growing levels of magnitude.
    It also alludes to a cyclic model of the universe which I think should be explored more often in science fiction.
    Of the stories that Isaac Asimov wrote, this is one of my favorites, but like many works of science fiction, it fails at characterization and emotional investment of the reader.

    Although this is a fictional story, it felt real and quite personal.
    The story manages to paint a detailed picture of how Afghanistan developed and some of the demographic and cultural challenges that existed in the country and how they changed or worsened over time.
    Its unflinching treatment of rape, abuse, war, ethnic cleansing and the harsh nature of Islam in Afghanistan made it quite impactful.
    The American perspective offered by the main character immigrating to the U.S. from Afghanistan to escape conflict is nothing new, but the Afghani perspective made it unique.
    Overall, it helped me to better understand the middle east as a whole, provided some perspective on the region, and left an emotional impression.

  explanation: >
    A great series run as part of the noitamin A programming blcok about children raised for consumption as human cattle trying to escape the farm they were raised on.
    This was never predictable and always managed to defy my expectations in interesting ways which is very rare.
    This has elements of many dystopian stories, but also has an element that is similar to a fairy tale as the name Neverland suggests.
    There are parallels to the human slave trade, current farming practices, as well as a deep conversation on purpose and what it means to be free.
    The allegorical aspects of the work should be noted.
    In terms of flaws, pacing could have been improved, but the source material may not have the same constraints that the series has, so it may have been better to read the manga.
    That said, this is easily one of the best works of Japanese story telling to come out recently and it sets itself up nicely for a second season that has a high level of potential.

    The only Thai film I have seen before this was Ong Bak.
    This was quite entertaining despite containing mistakes that I think the casual movie-goer will notice.
    While the concept of a heist style of storytelling is not completely new in television, it is quite novel within film, and the Thai perspective is an interesting one.
    The way this is filmed is exciting and stylized in a way that is not seen as qiote often nowadays and is usually not done quite as well when it is.
    Camera work and shots are handled extremely well and I have no complaints regarding the cinematography.
    The actual script could have used some work, mainly because most people who have taken a standardized test would understand how unrealistic some of the events in this film are.
    This could be mainly because the film was intended to appeal for the general Thai audience, but certain plot devices used can be jarring at times.
    That said, this is a fun heist film that manages to create engaging drama while also offering commentary on education and income classes within Thailand.

    While I do consider this to be flawed, I also consider this to be underrated as well with regards to critical acclaim.
    Clint Eastwood is one of the oldest active directors right now, but he still managed to make a compelling film despite his age.
    Richard Jewell is the story of a security guard that foiled a bomb attack in 1996 and was later investigated as a main suspect of the bomb attack he helped partially prevent.
    This is a film that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, manages to never get boring and stay emotionally impactful.
    It also manages to shine a light on problems such as malpractice and questionable actions by the media and government agencies.
    With regards to its flaws, it is somewhat simplistic in nature with many details lacking when it comes to character motivation.
    This is made up for by the skills of the actors, but most viewers who reflect on the film afterwards will most probably notice this.
    That said, I did enjoy this and thought its presentation of Richard Jewell's story was compelling.

  explanation: >
    Despite the critical acclaim for this film, I was not quite as impressed due to the what I considered to be a lot of wasted time.
    I believe this film could have been shorter and been more effective.
    In addition to this, I felt that it was lacking details with regards to the contents of the Pentagon papers which i believe resulted in a reduced impact.
    Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep performed well in their roles.
    The film was also able to successfully recreate the time in which the papers were released and paint a decent picture of how the Washington Post operated during that time.
    In terms of execution of the story, I was not as convinced.
    There is very little nuance or subtlety, and the messages that the film wanted to put forth were repeated in obvious ways that made it come across as though it was insulting the intelligence of the audience.
    Spielberg has made better films, and when it comes to films about journalism, there are better options like The Insider, Spotlight, Good Night, and Good Luck as well as All the President's Men.

    This, along with Parasite, got quite a bit of attention at Cannes in 2019 and rightly so.
    In many ways, this did for me what Call Me By Your Name could not and I consider this to be the better film.
    This was quite focused and functions as both a period piece as well as a romance story that is centered around women.
    The absence of men in this film was rather striking and the focus on painting in the 18th century was also interesting.
    The film is meditative, but not slow.
    Scenes can be sensual, but are never explicit and always have a certain tastefulness about them that fits with the rest of the general aesthetic.
    Color is used quite well in the film and mimics baroque and rococo art styles.
    I am not sure how it managed to do it, but this made me focus on nuances without boring me.
    This is a great film. I do not recommend watching this on a plane, however, due to the content.

    This is a haunting and dreamlike game that has the player exploring an island that has a similar look to that of the coast of Scotland.
    The only thing the player has the ability to do is move and choose the paths they take to get to the end.
    In that sense, it is a true walking simulator and feels like something a writer would make.
    The story told through the branching paths and requires multiple playthroughs to properly piece together the different paths to make a coherent story.
    Music is good and play time is short.
    On a technical level, the source engine and its quirks are on full display and as a result, it suffers from a few display issues.
    Generally speaking, this is thought provoking despite the small team that was needed to create it.
    The way it plays with the player's perception is probably most similar in approach to that of an M. Night Shyamalan film when executed correctly.

    My second Fellini film and my first fully Italian film.
    This was very interesting. All the dialogue was dubbed over in Italian, because the video was recorded without sound which gave the film a more surreal feeling.
    That said, the film was fairly surrealist to begin with, and the meta narrative of a film maker basically making the film that he is in is quite create and unique.
    Camera work is iconic with all scenes feeling like they had something special.
    Compared to many other films, this one is particularly dialogue heavy.
    It manages to take a simple story and turn it into commentary on art and relationships.
    There are many layers to this film, and I think it is very well suited for multiple viewings.

    This is a memorable game that manages to have an impact despite its somewhat smaller scope compared to other games.
    The game is accessible and I think it can be enjoyed by players of any age.
    Its design is relatively linear, but it had enough branching detail for players who have a more exploratory style of play.
    The subject matter is heavy and deals with the concept of mortality and sacrifice.
    Sound design is well done and also memorable.
    The music felt similar to many of works by studio Key and the game itself shares many similarities with Maeda Jun's works.
    Similarly, this also had many Japanese elements due to the background of the main developer Laura Shigihara who was also the composer and composed the music in To the Moon.
    When compared to To the Moon, I consider to be definitely superior with a better balance of story and gameplay and a more relatable story.
    I think this is one of the rare games that manages to enforce feelings of empathy and is definitely worth a playthrough.

    This is the definitive drift racing game, and the mechanics are handled very well.
    Different types of cars handle differently, which means that every car has a learning curve for mastering oversteering.
    The story mode does not have much of a story, but it is a good way to familiarize yourself with the mechanics.
    The visuals and the audio design are well done and feel similar to an outrun style aesthetic.
    There are a number of unique tracks which all emphasize different things which makes the experience stay fresh.
    The general feel of this is not like Initial D due to the lack of a Eurobeat soundtrack, but for a racing game, this is close to the top out of all the racing games I have played so far.

    This is a movie that has 3 languages: English, Italian, and French.
    With regards to this movie, this is a film with a lot of firsts for me.
    This is the first Italian language film that I have seen, the first Timothée Chalamet film that I have seen and the first film I have seen where homosexual men are the main characters.
    The film is well crafted with everything about it coming across as intentional and deliberate which places it on a higher level than many other films.
    In addition to that, I found it to be well acted and thought that Timothée Chalamet was deserving of his nomination for the academy awards.
    In terms of impact, I would say that it was not as impactful as I would have thought it would have been given its critical acclaim, but all of the acts of the narrative were well paced.
    That said, this is probably the type of movie that I would grow to appreciate more after multiple viewings.
    One final thing I appreciated about this film is how it references many works of literature I have never heard of which makes it a good movie to watch if you want to supplement your reading lists.
    After watching this, I would like to also watch the other films in Guadagnino's thematic "Desire" trilogy.

  explanation: > 
    After about 1 month's worth of delay, Space X finally carried out the SN8 high altitude flight test where they tried to test the belly landing.
    The altitude was not as high as what was originally planned, but it looks like the test was useful.
    It seems like this system has decent engine out capability as shown by its ability to fire different engines at different times.
    I expected the starship to take off based on the hop tests, but I was skeptical about whether it would land since they were doing the belly maneuver for the first time.
    Surprisingly enough, it was on target.
    I saw some interesting things in this test. The first is that some parts of the skirt seemed to catch on fire during the burning of the engines.
    The switch to an upright position during the landing also seemed to happen very quickly which won't be appropriate for a crewed flight.
    Finally, the landing burn happened far too late. I believe the landing would have been handled much better if the engines had a more controlled burn over a longer period of time and started firing earlier.
    I have high hopes for the next high altitude flight test.

    A series by NHK that I found to be a lot more rigorous than programming that can be found in American television or British television.
    The only series that I can consider to be even remotely comparable is Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.
    Unlike many similar programs that can be found in western media, this actually shows some mathematical syntax and explains how some essential formulas were developed over time in the 20th and 21st centuries.
    The four videos cover four topics which are particle physics, mass, the beginnings of the universe and string theory.
    As it presents these topics, the formulas associated with them and the researchers who discovered those formulas are covered in detail.
    The audience is taught fairly difficult concepts like the different types of symmetry, super symmetry, Calabi-Yau manifolds, partical physics, spin, M-theory, etc.
    Unlike other programs which may highlight the standard researchers like Einstein, Hawking and Newton, this program actually covers many researchers who are just as deserving of recognition despite not being covered as much in popular media.
    We are introduced to Dirac, Yang Chen-Ning, Matvei Petrovich Bronstein, Shinichiro Tomonaga, Yoichiro Nanbu, John Schwarz, Higgs, and many others who have been awarded for their research.

    This is not the best film directed by Philip Kaufman or even among the best horror or science fiction films that came out within the 70's.

    The practical special effects are well done.
    The writing in this film is good in many places and bad in some places, which is why I am conflicted with this.
    That said, it is a good film and it makes many relevant points through its premise which can be applied to modern culture's views on conspiracy theories and contagions.

    I consider this to be Zhang Yimou's return to form after many disappointing films.
    The narrative here is not particularly novel, but the third act felt almost Shakesperean and the duels felt reminiscient of jidaigeki films.
    The strength of this film is its visual style and cinematography which manages to make the entire film feel like an ink painting or a work of calligraphy.
    That, combined with the use of Daoist principles and concepts, make it very well done.
    When compared with movies like Hero this does not have a moral, the soundtrack is minimal, and the spectacle is on a smaller level.
    While this may not appeal to a larger audience, from a critical perspective, this is carefully crafted and technically consistent and original.

    What this shows is that the application of neural nets to problems that humans and traditional computing are unable to solve can result in satisfying results.
    The approach used here was apparently one that leveraged the graph-like structure to apply an attention based neural network to the problem.
    That said, there isn't an updated paper, so details regarding the architecture are a bit unclear.
    In the Nature paper, Deepmind used convolutional blocks and stochastic gradient descent which does not seem all that novel, so I am curious to see what changed between now and January.

    It was originally announced that there would be no Red Bull BC One this year due to COVID-19, so this completely took me by surprise.
    The competition felt weird because there was no audience in the stadium.
    That said, everything else was good.
    The lineups were good.
    The judging made sense.
    Commentary was good.
    The camera work was actually not that bad this time.
    The MC was sub par, but acceptable.
    The music was acceptable with some good tracks.
    Starting at the quarter finals meant that everyone had a fresh set of moves that they could use for the entire competition.
    Shigekix winning was not surprising at all given that he competed at a high level from a young age and the level of conditioning that he had combined with his musicality was simply incredible.
    What is even more surprising is that his current form compared to two years or even one year ago is on another level and the rate of improvement is something I have not seen before.
    He simply smoked all the competition in such a way that he made the strongest competitors look mediocre.

    This game's strengths lie in its gameplay.
    The shooter mechanics are fluid and the use of slow motion was also nice.
    It felt similar to Half-Life, but the physics were not used as a mechanic by the player.
    It also felt like Halo, but the weapon selection and enemy variety was limited in comparison.
    What makes it unique is its horror tropes which seem to be inspired by Japanese film.
    However, that premise was not fully utilized which prevented it from being as great as the other games mentioned.

  explanation: >
    A surprisingly modern film that is quite representative of the times it was made in.
    During the late 90's and early 2000's, mainstream film had quite an experimental streak with many films playing with time such as Nolan's Memento and Zhang Yimou's Hero.
    This film is not different, and like Hero, it also plays with color for each of its characters.
    Because of this, it is not particularly original given the films that preceed it even when compared with Mani Ratnam's other works like Alai Payuthey which also played with time.
    Even the quick editing felt reminiscent of some of the earlier works of Darren Aronofsky and Danny Boyle which also came out during the same time.
    That said, I enjoyed this simply due to its momentum, tight script, and well acted characters.
    The use of three colors for three characters, three ages, and three classes to highlight strata within South Indian society was well done.
    It's main glaring weakness are action scenes which Mani Ratnam seems to struggle with for some strange reason despite his ability to film choreography for music and large groups of people.
    The music is modern and the use of Tamil lyrics combined with modern genres is handled very well.
    Its runtime is long, but it does not drag, making it time well spent.

    A short story about an AI called AM that tortures humans within a virtual world without allowing them the option of death after human civilization has collapsed.
    The premise is interesting, and I have seen similar concepts in other science fiction stories, but this is the only book to try to thoroughly explore it.
    That said, the exploration of the premise is not that thorough mainly because the story is short.
    The way in which AM tortures humans makes sense, but does not seem to be the most effective way of causing distress and pain.
    I would have expected the form of suffering to be less physical and more psychological, but perhaps such schemes cannot be covered within a short story.
    It may be interesting to also play the game that is based off of this.

  explanation: >
    This is a novel that offers a lot of clarity regarding Jeff Bezos as well as the growth of Amazon.
    Although Amazon is currently one of the largest companies, the journey that was taken was not always one of an upward trajectory and was filled with ups and downs.
    The emphasis on the customer as well as Amazon's culture and Jeff Bezos' volatility offers quite a bit of insight into the company for those who are only familiar with Amazon's public face.
    Another interesting thing to note is that although Amazon is viewed as a tech company today, this was not always the case, and it is interesting to how a company that is older than Google managed to live through the tech bubble and the recession of 2008 to become what it is today.
    One thing that I found myself agreeing with is that information should be presented with some narrative, and this strategy should be more widely adopted.
    This has many similarities with Walter Isaacson's novel about Steve Jobs, but I think this is worth the read despite it being, in my opinion, inferior to Isaacson's works.

  explanation: >
    Despite the heavy theme of mortality, this film can have surprisingly light hearted moments.
    When compared to a film like Ikiru, I prefered Ikiru, but this is unique and easier to digest.
    The character of Anand was original and memorable which his primary characteristic of making friends with everyone he meets.
    The uniqueness of the main character is what made this film, and without him, this would have not been as memorable.
    This combined with the death of Anand made for a story with a lot of depth that was presented in a minimalistic manner that anyone would be able to appreciate.
    Outside of Anand, there were no mistakes made, but camera work and other technical achievements were relatively unremarkable.
    Overall, it is understandable why this is praised as one of the best Hindustani language films.

  image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Soma_Game_Art.png
  explanation: >
    The title of this game originates from the Greek word 'soma' which means body.
    This is a game with a great hard sci-fi story that had above average gameplay.
    On a technical level, it was superb with distinct levels, good dialogue, and some of the best sound design I have seen in a game.
    The post-apocalyptic underwater setting was similar to Bioshock, but the use of detailed claustrophobic underwater habitats/facilities helped with the horror aspect of the game.
    The story is what impressed me the most, and it seemed to draw on many of the same themes as that of Ghost in the Shell and The Matrix that touches upon concepts of free will and conciousness which is often covered within classic Greek philosophy.
    The gameplay mostly consists of a series of sequences where you try to get from point A to point B while avoiding certain monsters that you are powerless against while navigating some moral dilemmas that don't affect the ending.
    For someone who has made video games, and understand how game engines work, the horror was not quite as effective for me and had a certain level of predictability, but the jump scares were sometimes effective.
    For a hard sci-fi story, there isn't a big reveal at the end, and the story has many smaller reveals that give the story a slow burn.
    The concepts covered in this game also have some repercussions for technologies that might be developed in the future such as teleportation, digital legacy, cybernetics, simulation, and the technological singularity.

  explanation: >
    This book makes a distinction between shallow work and deep work and states that deep work is more valuable because it leads to new ideas and is not easily replicable.
    This is partially true, but only if the shallow work is something anyone can do. If you are used to doing something that no one else can do, it can be shallow.
    Because of this, on the face of things, this book seems to offer sound advice for deep meditative working conditions, but it also fails to quantify the effect of deep work in a rigorous manner.
    It may be preferable to actually read the research behind the book rather than the book itself, since the book seems to be directed more towards a general reading audience.
    That said, since I am used to completing a lot of different types of work and using an algorithmic approach, this book was not quite as useful for me.

    I was impressed by this work by a Taiwanese Indie company.
    The gameplay is like Ori and the Blind Forest with a little bit of Metroid mixed in.
    The story is a tragedy with a little bit of cosmic horror mixed in.
    In fact, this is probably the one of the only works of cosmic horror that I found to be effective although the way in which it was presented may have been a bit lacking.
    The use of multiple endings based on whether the player finds all of a certain item in multiple locations was a nice touch.
    It is not particularly groundbreaking, but what it manages to do, it does very well.
    The mechanics of single directional jumping is not completely original, but it is used very well.
    Art direction is well done, and the general environment design and color pallete felt reminiscient of high budget anime films from the 1980's and 1990's.
    Although this is Taiwanese, this felt like a work that might have been made in Japan a few decades ago.
    The music is well done and memorable.
    Overall, this is a great game that deserves better marketing.

    A surprisingly well written short story that managed to make a somewhat prescient premise that manages to predict the internet, social media, content creation, automation, and environmental collapse.
    This is particularly impressive when one considers that the story was written more than 110 years ago.
    Like many other works during the time like The Time Machine and Brave New World, this draws on dystopian themes as well as older philosophical works like Plato's Allegory of the Cave to make an entertaining read that is thought provoking.
    Overall, this is original, but also feel dated which adds to the charm.

    I enjoyed this more than The Departed, but The Departed might be the better film from a critical perspective.
    This film is one of the best Hong Kong films I have seen, and its strengths lie in its editing and pacing.
    The idea of having moles on both the side of the criminals and the side of the police works here just as well as in The Departed, and the setting of Hong Kong made the film feel fresher when compared to The Departed.
    The use of Buddhist themes to supplement the premise was also interesting.
    This is good in its own way and functions as a great thriller while the Departed is more of a drama.

    This is a good film with casteism as its primary theme.
    Films like this can get preachy, but this film is not.

    There are different dialects of Tamil presented, and as well as a profile of different castes.
    We are shown what college life is like in South India, as well as the concept of quota.
    There are also references to B. R. Ambedkar not only in the script, but also with the use of the color blue.
    Acting by Kathir in particular was well done with his ability to effectively express emotions with just his eyes.
    On a technical level, there are many shots and sequences that are fantastic while there are some jarring sequences that could have been improved with better editing.

  explanation: >
    This is not so much a game, but a tool for establishing a habit of meditation.
    While I did not find it useful for mindfulness, it helped me establish permanent nose breathing and reduced sensitivity in my sinuses.
    This has a variety of meditation techniques such as abdominal breathing, breathing for calmness, breathing for relaxation, guided audio meditations and offers a visual guide to match your breathing with.
    Unfortunately, it is missing holotropic breathing and Wim Hof breathing as well as other techniques.
    By utilizing this game, I have spent more than 10 hours meditating over a period of more than 140 days.
    The game allows for the player to choose the duration of the meditations to fit their busy schedule, but the longer the session, the better the results.
    I recommend a minimum of 8 minutes per session for the best time to performance ratio.
    To go from beginning to completion requires patience.
    With regards to the game itself, the primary goal is to grow an ecosystem by meditating.
    The more days you spend meditating, the more the environment grows.
    Once the game is completed, you are given an island that you can walk through and plant trees in.
    The trees grow the more you meditate.
    Overall, this is not perfect, but it seems to be the best meditation app I have found so far and should be effective for most people's purposes.

    This is a great game.
    It is ambitious despite providing a linear experience and offers a high concept story that is thought provoking.
    In the case of this game, while the gameplay seemed fairly standard when compared to the first Bioshock, it is the story that makes it shine.
    Unlike the first game which takes place in the underwater city of Rapture, the main campaign of this game takes place in the floating city of Columbia.
    Unlike previous games, this felt more like an American take on a Jules Verne style concept, but backs up the extraordinary premise with quantum theory which was researched by Procopiu and Bohr close to the same year in which the game takes place (1912).
    Characters are convincing, and the main AI companion of Elizabeth was both endearing and well developed without being an obstacle during gameplay.
    There are quite many concepts covered in this such as alternate realities, free will, and other existentialist themes.
    This, in combination with many social issues that plagued the United States in the early 1900's made for a very unique experience.
    The Burial at Sea missions offered an interesting connection with the events in the first Bioshock and offered an interesting continuation of the main campaign.
    Overall, there are not many games that are as polished and well thought out as this one, and I consider it to be one of the greats.

    The premise is that you as the player are stuck in a time loop where you are in a conversation with another version of yourself from 35 years in the future where climate change has doomed humanity.
    The concept is refreshing and it manages to work despite the simple interface provided.
    It also provides an interesting take on time travel as well as a corollary of simulation theory which has similar properties.
    Overall, it manages to make an impact with its short playtime.

    This is a game that is rough around the edges, but has quite a bit of depth and ambition.
    This also manages to provide one of the few convincing implementations of the hero's journey in games in a way that does not represent the world as simply black and white that I have seen.
    This is a game that had a good idea, a good premise, good music, good mechanics, good voice acting, and a unique story, but struggles on the technical side of things.
    There is a richness in assets with different enemy types, high character customizability and freedom that is common in open world games and MMORPGs.
    That said, the world is small and not all that populated.
    NPC AI can be limited which can make the world feel shallow despite the detail that it has.
    This can make the game tedious at times and also frustrating due to its difficulty.
    This is a game that moves slowly.
    This can be a good thing because it can emphasize the player's investment, but it can also make for a negative experience for more casual players.
    Overall, I enjoyed it.
    It has quite a bit of replay value, and it encourages exploration.
    If it were fleshed out more and had more depth to the non-gameplay related elements, it would be tremendously better.
    Interestingly enough, there is a show that is based off of this, and I am curious to see if it fares better than the game.

    This is one of those movies that is enjoyable and brilliantly shot.
    In many ways, this feels like a Disney animated film brought to life.
    For a musical, this has a certain level of intelligence in it.
    Topics like class struggle, language as a way of attaining higher positions is still relevant today.
    In addition to this, this film provides a unique window into the English language.
    Sets and locations are colorful and well constructed and music does not take away from the story.
    Hepburn does great in this as she does in everything she is in and she outclasses all other actors in the film.
    While many musicals can be quite shallow this manages to go deeper to provide an engaging experience.

    In addition to this, some of the unity assets that were used in this game were used in some of my games as well.

    Coffee Talk is a visual novel style game that is similar to other bartending games, but in this game you are a barista that serves coffee.
    The crux of the gameplay involves experiencing the story through the customers that visit the store.
    These customers are made more interesting due to the world that the game takes place in which has fantasy elements in a modern world like Bright or Fables.
    These elements are utilized in a way that they are able to tackle themes like racism, traditionalism, and general societal changes.

    Multiple playthroughs make the content engaging, and it is interesting to see how the news affects individual people from different walks of life.
    What is most interesting is that providing a fair and balanced view of both sides of an issue can lead to distrust because people expect an angle and distrust that which is feigning honesty.

    This is an example of a good premise being wasted.
    Time manipulation is something with many possibilities, but in this game, the possibilities are limited.
    In addition to this, the use of time travel without any sense of strategy made it feel like a standard first person shooter that just has scenes that take place in the present and the past.
    You as the player have no decision making in how the time travel works.
    In additon to this, enemies either fall into generic soldiers or generic monsters.
    The mechanics are simply not all that compelling.
    Story is given through exposition. Only the variety of weapons seemed decent.
    Overall, this is like a substandard Bioshock clone.

    This felt like the western world's equivalent to 人間失格 and like an adult's version of Catcher in the Rye.
    Although the contents of this are said to be absurd, this felt very real, and may not be considered all that absurd in our modern world.
    The purpose of life and the emptiness in it are well conveyed.
    Unlike other great novels that I've recently read, this actually felt like it had impact and it was straight to the point.
    In terms of existentialism, I consider this work to be rather great and very accessible.

    The ending really tied things up for me in a satisfying way.
    Most jokes are funny, but Mickey Rooney's performance as Yunioshi felt unnecessary and lacked the cleverness that could be found in the rest of the film.

    This is one of those games where the medium is able to take advantage of its capability to hybridize itself with other artistic mediums.
    In this case, it manages to create what is essentially a film with choice.
    While other games may have cgi characters, this is composed of fully acted FMV's that have quality that is similar to what may be found in decent modern television dramas.
    Some acting in this can be lacking, but the main character is well executed.
    The story itself is not anything particularly innovative. It is a heist-gone-wrong style crime drama.
    That said, it is entertaining.
    It shows potential in the future of gaming and television and is something that can offer a more personalized experience for each individual viewer.

  explanation: >
    This released worldwide earlier than it did in the United States.
    The general directorial feel of this is that it is like a cross between something Hitchcock and Shane Carruth would come up with.
    Compared to other Nolan films, this is very stripped down with most, if not all, of the focus on the plot.
    As a result, character development is more limited and it is harder to find an overarching theme or emotional hook like other Nolan films.
    On the technical side, this is an example of a director who knows what he wants and executes without any compromises regardless of whatever limitations may be brought on by the premise.
    Everything is practical including many aspects of scenes that are supposed to be happening as a result of time inversion.
    In terms of negatives, the film does not pay off until the second half when the time inversion mechanic is utilized in an unrestrained manner.
    Nolan spends half of the film setting things up which can be tedious, but the payoff is good.
    That said, despite its unrestrained nature, I felt that the idea was not pushed to its limits.
    In terms of replay value, this has it due to the nature of the palindrome-like structure.
    Scenes happening in reverse are accompanied by a smartly composed score by Ludwig Göransson that also has parts that can be played in reverse.
    Acting by all players is well done.
    If you are familiar with the mechanics, you may notice most of the details and predict the second half, but this is worthy of multiple viewings despite its shortcomings compared to other Nolan films.

    This is my first Billy Wilder film and my first Marilyn Monroe film.
    The script is clever, but not so clever that it loses its comedic value.
    The setting of the 1920's made this feel like a pre-code Hollywood film due to its racy content which only added to its authenticity.
    This is also probably the only film I've seen with crossdressing as a comedic gag that was actually good.
    While this has been stated to be one of the greatest films ever made, I would not go quite that far due to some aspects of the film being good but not particularly unique or innovative.
    That said, I think this is worth watching, and that its comedy is enjoyable even today.

    An example of narrative done well in video games, and one of the better historical games that I have played.
    The representation of WWI was well done with historical context given to all of the locations and scenes that play out.
    In particular, the focus on the French effort was interesting, and something that is not covered all that often in media.
    The casualty rate of the war was well portrayed.
    While not everything was historically accurate, and liberties were taken, it managed to ground itself within actual events that played out in the war to deliver an emotional journey.
    All chaacters were given some level of development, and the story was not predictable.
    Overall, I consider this underrated.

    An update from Neuralink that was made for the purpose of recruiting.

    This is one of those movies that does not make major mistakes, but also does not make any particularly audacious moves other than its premise.
    From an American perspective this is unique in that it is a bilingual film that takes place mostly in China, and provides a unique perspective on Chinese culture.
    Awkwafina's Mandarin skills as an ABC were convincingly mediocre, and her acting, while not particularly memorable, did the job.

    Although this is a favorite of many fans of the series due to nostalgia, I found it rather tedious.
    While the ideas presented here had potential, the execution made it hard to enjoy.
    With the improvements brought by the PS2, you would expect the world presented to be more vivid, but while it feels real and feels larger, it also feels somewhat empty.
    The gameplay is more linear and exploration is not encouraged as much as previous entries.
    FMV's look great, but their in game counterparts look lifeless in comparison, which indicates that the improvements in technology did not lead to an improvement in the general player experience.
    This game could have just as easily been made for PS1, but with less complex graphics and no voice acting and it might have been improved in the process.
    The music is good, and the story seems to draw from an amalgamation of religious ideologies and South Asian/Oceanic cultures with its concepts of dying to save the world from sin.
    Side characters don't have the level of development given in other entries, and the English voice acting is absolutely horrible (which is a product of the times).
    I am sure some people may enjoy it, but when grinding and the end game feels like work, I consider the product to be flawed.

    A very unique film with good production value and film technique.
    The story is very simple, but the way in which it is executed is what makes this work.
    The dialogue is short and not particularly elaborate, but it still manages to be poetic.
    The closest thing I could think of was what can be seen in Wong Kar-wai films, but Wong Kar-wai films can be more meandering at times.
    That said, I don't think Wong Kar-wai did something on the level of the single 1 hour+ take in the second half of this film.
    Apparently this film involved three cinematographers, but I honestly had trouble telling.
    This is a dreamlike film that I am surprised has not received more attention in the west given its general quality and its success in China.

    This is a film that is completely dependent on its script and the actors who manage to sell it.
    This comes as no surprise since this is from the same director as The Princess Bride
    There is a certain cynicism in the writing which makes this romantic comedy more endearing than other entries in the genre.

    The premise of the first season is being stretched to its limit, while it is a good premise, the original idea is not used well in this film.
    This film's best aspects are the short runtime and the sound design.
    Other than that, the film seems to lack an overall focus and does not have a particular message or goal.
    The idea of mental health being related to a person's criminality is an interesting topic to cover, but the ideas are never actually explored, but rather just used as a back drop for some sort of mediocre crime drama.

    This is not an easy movie to watch, but the amount of deliberate touches and artistic flair make it something with its own identity.
    Danny Boyle has a unique style, and the methods and techniques he uses here are very similar to what can be found in Requiem for a Dream.
    Unlike Requiem for a Dream, this is a bit more light hearted, and the ending is not quite as bleak in nature.
    Ewan McGregor's performance here is great, and he executes the script very well.
    I was not a fan of some of the toilet humor in the begining of the film, but the later parts of the movie more than make up for it.

    For a 90 year old movie, this surprised me in many ways.
    The level of violence was unrestrained, the themes are mature, and this ultimately does not shy away from showing war as it truly is.
    As my first pro-code film, this impressed me very much.
    Scenes of war looked very real despite some frame rate issues, and the perspective of the Germans was something that I thought was very ambitious given how controversial it might have been.
    Given that this was made during a time that was not that long after WWI, the general look of the film is very similar to what one might have seen during the actual war.
    In terms of camera work, the film felt like it was at least 20 years ahead of its time in certain scenes in terms of how it used movement.
    Despite it being as old as it is, there are parts of this film that feel modern.

    The works of Charles and Ray Eames were influential to many film directors who grew up in the 60's and 70's.

    One of the best games I have ever played and criminally underrated.
    Everything is improved over previous entries.
    The story is mature and told with a poetic flair, the dogfights are intense, there is choice and mission variety as well as an ace style system.
    Although this takes place in an alternate reality, the war that the player experiences in this game is a mixture of WWII and the Bosnian war and references to Arthurian legend are made in parts of the story.
    The music is also better than in previous entries with a mixture of different types of genres as well as the use of Flamenco guitar as a motif.
    The planes themselves, which were designed in partnership with major aerospace companies, are also very intricate and detailed.
    In light of the series, this is not particularly innovative, but on its own merits, it is great.
    This series, overall, should receive more attention and praise, but it seems like it has not due to the niche nature of its content.

  explanation: >
    A very intellectual work set in a bizarre post 9/11 future where biotechnology and AR are ubiquitous.
    The main premise is focused on an exaggerated application of the Sapir Whorf hypothesis where speaking certain words with a specific grammar can eventually lead to genocidal behavior by inception.
    There are some very unique ideas presented here such as the use of civil war as a way to enforce class separation, the rhetoric of tyranny, and the recurrence of genocide as a byproduct of human evolution.
    All of these are controversial, but all of these have some rational basis which is what makes them particularly interesting as an area of study.
    The combination of linguistics and anthropology with the direction the world is heading in is something that has only been done in MGSV.
    Depiction of American politics and military is not accurate, but it does make for good entertainment.
    Generally, the story seems like something that Kojima or Oshii might have come up with, but the presentation is lacking.
    The main problems here are the lack of character development, the flawed pacing, and the subpar presentation, but everything else is very interesting.
    I'm not sure if this would be considered a good movie, but the content of the story is very interesting.
    The novel this is based on may be a better use of time than the film.

    This is insightful, but also limited by the state of psychology during a time when it was more of a pseudoscience.
    I can also see how the arguments postulated here fit into the basis of some of Jordan Peterson's work.
    For anyone reading this, the ideas of the id, ego, and unconcious stem from Freudian psychology, so familiarity with the field should be expected going into this work.
    There is quite a bit of ground covered here.
    Carl Jung talks about the role of the individual, how the individual is constructed, how the individual can get lost in the masses, and the influences and reach of the individual within larger society.
    He frames the microconcepts involving individual psychology within larger political and societal concerns of the time like the cold war.
    Overall, this is not a bad read, and it can help one to understand one's place in the world.
    There is an emphasis on the west and religion as a foil to the state and tyranny, but I chalk this up to a byproduct of the times.

    When this was announced, I was looking forward to a stealth based game, but then PlatinumGames took over the development, and it became something different.
    The gameplay became more high paced, but it kept many elements of the original vision.
    This is a game that is very high paced, high energy, and there is very little that is quite like it.
    The story is cartoonish in comparison to other works in the Metal Gear Solid series, but as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is very enjoyable.
    I recommend reading The Selfish Gene before playing this game, because there are many references to memes.

    It is very interesting to see how intelligent humans were during a time when civilization itself as a concept was still somewhat new.
    Despite this being as old as it is, it is understandable and fairly relatable.
    This reads very much like other bronze age era stories where lessons are taught by vicariously experiencing them through some character.
    In the case of the epic of Gilgamesh, the focus is on mortality and grief.
    Although humans can live forever through immortality, this epic shows that humans can also live on through their legacy.
    It is also interesting to note how monotheistic religions seemed to plagiarize concepts from this epic.

    The conclusion of the story is interesting, but not as entertaining as the first part.
    While the first part was interesting due to its exploration of the loop mechanic, the second part focuses more on character development.
    This makes it have less momentum than part 1, but a more fleshed out world.
    Unlike Edge of Tomorrow, the ending in this is far more tragic, and the mechanics by which the looping occurs is different.
    The looping in the manga is more believable and mimics the principles by which memories are sent back in time in Steins;Gate.
    Overall, I think this is a great series that is very unique, and that while this is better than Edge of Tomorrow, Edge of Tomorrow also has its own unique appeal.
    In terms of the reading experience, the vocabulary is not particularly difficult for someone who is fluent and furigana is provided, so it is not a bad way to practice Japanese.

  explanation: >
    I have a mixed impression of this film.
    While it is superior to the 70's Battle for the Planet of the Apes, the writing in this felt weak and seemed to depend on the stupidity of humans as the primary thing that moves the plot forward.
    While the original series had a certain mystery about it that had viewers piece together events to figure out how each film fits in the whole scheme of things, the reboot is told in chronological order.
    Also, anyone who knows anything about apes knows that being intelligent is not enough to speak like a human especially when the throat of an ape has not been evolved to make human-like sounds.
    In terms of positives, the subject matter is very relevant to current events.
    There is a simian flu, a weird skepticism of science among some of the characters, and a general lack of trust between the major parties.
    Drama among the apes seems Shakespearean.
    If this was better written, I might recommend it, but the use of some tired tropes made it an irritating experience for me.

    This is a story of Gregor Samsa turning into a cockroach.
    The subject matter is surreal, and the way in which the transformation was handwaved made it seem bizarre.
    The impact the transformation had on his family made up the majority of the story.
    It is difficult to say what this book is truly trying to say, but the story can be related to society, depression, and familial relations.
    For a short story, it could have been made even shorter and still accomplished the same thing, but overall, it is interesting.

    It provides enough variety to entertain.
    In terms of negatives, there is not much weapon variety, mediocre AI, and voice acting can sometimes miss the mark.

  explanation: >
    Silent films are not easy to watch or enjoy due lower image quality in addition to the use of text to indicate dialogue.
    The last silent film I liked was Metropolis.
    In the case of Nosferatu, the image quality lends itself to the horror and the use of black and white works to the advantage of the lighting.
    With regards to the acting, it is difficult to tell whether the acting is good or not because it is hard for subtlety to be conveyed to the audience without the ability to convey everything through physical movement.
    That said, Max Schreck in this case is difficult to imitate, making his performance very memorable despite it looking comical at times.
    Generally, as long as you don't take this too seriously, I think it is easier to appreciate the work and craftsmanship that went into this.
    Small things such as the use of a hyena as a werewolf make this a fun watch.

    A respectable, but flawed film from a young director with mostly unknown actors.
    This clearly had a lot of work put into it, but this also seemed to value style over substance in certain aspects.
    Editing and camera work ended up being jerky and this hurt the pacing despite some common practices being followed.
    Color grading was well done.
    While this does follow tropes in the mystery and crime genre, events are spoonfed while twists and turns end up being forced with very little to prompt them.
    As a result, this ends up being a film that does some things great and some things in a flawed manner.

    Towards the end of my first trip to Japan, there were a number of sales happening to promote the Japanese opening of Edge of Tomorrow in Japan.
    As part of this promotion, the manga and original novel of All You Need is Kill (which is the source material for the film) were being sold at a discount.
    Although six years have passed, I am finally getting to reading the copy that I bought.
    Since I already saw Edge of Tomorrow six years ago, comparisons will be made.
    I consider this to be superior to Edge of Tomorrow (so far) due to the focus that has been placed on the time loop rather than the enemy.
    Characters' pasts are actually covered here.
    All You Need is Kill also does not shy away from the violence and provides a bleaker outlook on humanity's war against the ギタイ.
    The aliens that show up are different and appear far more terrifying in my opinion.
    This is also more clearly made for Japanese sensibilities as indicated by the tropes seen within the first manga.
    So far, this is very good, and I am hoping that the second manga improves on what was established in the first.

    This is classic Alfred Hitchcock where he creates suspense by withholding information from the viewer.
    By trying to piece together a case by viewing people through their windows Hitchcock creates a premise that gives him a lot of freedom.
    While the shots used are repetitive, we do see each window act as a frame through which to place the camera such that small differences are emphasized.
    Topics such as voyeurism and the ethics of observing a crime or suicide are also covered.
    In terms of acting, James Stewart was not all that impressive (because he plays James Stewart like he does in all his movies) with many of the actresses overshadowing him.
    While much of the attention towards the actors goes towards the voyeurs, credit should be given to the actors who play the role of the observed as well.
    In addition to this, there is something of a meta narrative here where each room represents a tv channel.
    Overall, there are many way to interpret different aspects of this film which makes it a work that is worthy of being studied.

    Read this in the original Japanese as a way to practice and review the language.
    When compared to the feature film, this varies quite a bit because it reads more like a modern day Indiana Jones except artifacts are protected instead of stolen.

    Imagery and the composition of each frame is carefully thought out.
    The story records how a man lived his last days and the aftermath.
    By doing so, it manages to make a statement regarding society, life, purpose, family, and work.
    In addition to this, it is also a good documentation of the state Japan was in after recovering from the second world war.

    This is more a film about Mr. Rogers' philosphy rather than about Mr. Rogers himself.
    As a result, Tom Hanks' character's screen time is limited and the main focus is placed on the character played by Matthew Rhys.
    Tom Hanks plays his character well, but not perfectly, and smaller mannerisms don't seem to be recreated.
    I think the overall story is well structured and it does not try to be overly ambitious which allows for it to reduce mistakes.
    What this does well is that it shows humans as imperfect and how to deal with a chaotic world in a positive manner while dealing an emotional message.

    Not as great as Ace Combat 4 in terms of gameplay, and not as ambitious in story when compared to Ace Combat 3.
    There are a sufficient number of missions and the focus on geopolitics, while lacking realism, manages to provide a good parallel to cold war era politics.
    One thing that is improved in comparison to the other games is that there is a clearer arc that can be followed with the characters which may make it more crowd pleasing.
    However, when compared to AC4, this also means that there is a decrease in realism.
    Levels lack variety and don't seem to offer much in terms of innovation compared to previous installments.
    The AI of enemy planes actually seems to be worse despite the fact that programming such AI should be relatively straight forward.
    Finally, unlike previous installments, there is not a single ace who acts as the antagonist within the story which made this feel somewhat lacking.
    Overall, this is like Ace Combat 4 with more content, but less refinement.
    I enjoyed it and consider it to be a cut above many games made today.
    One thing to note is that the animations seemed to be made with English in mind rather than Japanese, so English audio is recommended.

    Being a PS1 game, graphics and gameplay are limited in comparison to Ace Combat 4, but the basic mechanics are there, and the game feels modern.
    Storywise, this is a cut above other games due to its coverage of geopolitics and technology in a future where world powers are corporations instead of countries.

    This holds similarities to Catch-22, but the themes that it tackles are different and the way in which events are presented are wildly different..
    The narrative structure of this book basically involves time skips between different events in Billy Pilgrim's life.

    With the mix of real world events and fantastical elements, there is some discussion of free will, being able to change events in the future, and hope.
    Commentary on war is also hidden within the prose where PTSD and viewpoints on other nationalities are described through the eyes of POW's during WWII.

    A series from Yavapai College.
    Despite this being a community college course, it is actually very technical and is dense with data and terminology.
    I think the high level may be due to this being a 200 level course in Geology which I have no experience in.
    This covers things from the basic atmospheric makeup to cloud formation/classification to atmospheric optics.
    This is a very thorough lecture series and covers almost everything you would want to know about Meteorology at the introductory level.

    The title means demon destruction blade, and the story focuses on its main character beginnings as he gains the skills to kill demons.
    The production quality for this work is on the level of feature films and seems like overkill which is typical for studio Ufotable.
    The animation is fluid and integrates both 2d and 3d methods.
    The score is handled by Yuki Kajiura who is my favorite Japanese composer.
    That said, the writing seems to be typical modern shounen fare which means that I don't consider it to be novel despite its great execution.
    Demon slaying has already been presented in other works within the medium (although maybe not as well or in the same way).
    Despite this, there is a high amount of care given to character presentation and development, and while the plot is not innovative, it does nothing wrong.
    References to Japanese history is done well, with its depiction of a vibrant and varied Taisho period Japan.
    The story did not impress me as much as its technical achievements, but I can understand why it is highly rated since it does not make major mistakes and does a lot right.

  explanation: >
    I have already seen Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and seeing how this is his first film with sound, it is interesting to see how he uses it to his advantage with editing.
    From a cultural perspective, it is interesting to see how Germany was in the 1930's especially during a time when the Nazi's were coming into power.
    In terms of cinematography, it is similar to Metropolis, but carefully planned shots make the compositional quality of each frame rather high.
    In addition to this, with improvements in technology, the camera is portable enough to actually follow characters around.
    A good example of this is a shot that tracks Peter Lorre's character and zooms in during a chase.
    In terms of story, this handles suspense and moral dilemma's well.
    The first half depicts the search for the child murderer well, and the last part handles topics such as insanity, the legal system, and punishment.
    Overall, a great film, and one of Germany's best.

    There are not a lot of games that have a retro eastern European aesthetic, and the look of this work is just one of its unique characteristics.
    There are references to many different works like Final Fantasy, NES games, and it uses these references to essentially steal mechanics from other games for one hit gags.
    Art direction is well done and varied with many different styles of art being included. Along with all this, there are FMV's, some of which include live action sequences.
    Puzzles are bizarre and take advantage of the strange post apocalyptic surreal world of Paradigm to create unique challenges that would not work in any other point and click adventure.

  explanation: >
    This is the most tightly constructed film I've seen in a long time.
    The editing is deliberate, and each scene has a logical flow.
    It doesn't have a dull moment, and is best watched in a single sitting.
    It is also unique, because this is one of the few films where almost all the characters have questionable morals.
    The casting does come across as bizarre, because they seem to have casted the least Italian looking people to play Italian Americans.
    This is most likely due to that fact that David O. Russel prefers to work with actors he has worked with in some of his previous films.
    If Martin Scorcese made a heist film, it might be similar to this due to the pacing.

    One of the best fighting games and one of the best games on the ps2 is also one of the most frustrating.
    For each character, there is usually more than 70 moves, and the cpu seem to sometimes cheat by using previously used moves to anticipate what the player will do.
    For many of the harder fights, it is necessary to win by using cheap moves instead of mastering the fighting system.
    Outside of that, presentation is nice, characters from different countries actually speak their language instead of using dubbing.
    There is quite a bit of depth offered here, but the game does not hold your hand and expects you to have the patience to master the movesets and mechanics for each of the characters.

  explanation: >
    For a Quentin Tarantino film, this is not his best, but is at the level of some of his other well known films.
    Much of the craziness found in other films is rather subdued in this one.
    The first 2 hours of this very long film are basically an indulgent journey through 60's era Hollywood with a focus on television rather than film.
    Some shots from older shows are recreated, and references to films from that time are made.
    In the last 45 minutes, we suddenly get a narrator, and we see some of what Tarantino is most known for.
    Historical accuracy gets thrown out the window by that point and things go from 0 to 100 quick.
    Overall, this is most similar to Inglorious Basterds, and while it is not perfect, if you are familiar with film from the era, this may be entertaining.
    That said, it does feel bloated and indulgent, and there are some scenes that could be edited out.

  explanation: >
    A very insightful book that basically shows how all forms of life is composed of greedy functions from the elements that they are made of to the behaviors that they exhibit.
    While it may imply that there is an intent behind everything, the way I like to think of it is that it is the result of stochastic processes that prioritize survival or try to optimize a particular metric.
    This is also where the term 'meme' is apparently coined, and Richard Dawkin's use of it is very creative, because it is able to use the greedy nature of genes to extrapolate to human culture and behavior.
    There are also applications of economics which can be used to determine the optimal condition, and then show how evoluationary processes can lead to local optima.
    Overall, this was very fascinating.

    Even voice acting is better.
    I recommend playing only this in the series, because this entry even has a recap of events in the first game.

  explanation: >
    Played and upscaled on epsxe.
    Because of its age and status as what is probably the first rhythm game and one of the only rapping games, the experience was somewhat frustrating.
    Playing on easy means that you can only play through half of the songs which means that you need to play on normal if you want the full experience.
    Timings don't match up with what is on the screen which means that you need to have an understanding of the underlying timings if you want a good score.
    The visual style is rather unique for the era given that 2d animation within a 3d environment was rarely done prior to this game in many mediums.
    All versions of this game have the same voice acting and music which means that the Japanese version really only differs in terms of its menu and subtitles.

  explanation: >
    This is like a cross between Apollo 13 and Gravity.
    This is unique in that it provides a cosmonaut's viewpoint, and it actually has a somewhat realistic portrayal of orbit.
    Music is good, but the story is not entirelyy historically accurate.
    There were quite a lot of dramatic liberties taken, and I felt that a more realistic approach might have worked better.
    Some of the liberties taken involved fabricating entire events to make partially political statements which did not add much to the quality of the story as a whole.
    That said, for something that was created on a significantly smaller budget than many of its Hollywood equivalents, this is rather impressive.

  explanation: >
    Played using PCSX2.
    This is one of the best horror games and one of the best games of all time.
    That does not mean it is perfect, but the imperfections seem to be intentional.
    Dialogue and voice acting is awkward and stilted.
    The controls are clunky, and it is difficult to find items within levels which bears similarity to earlier Resident Evil games.
    I ultimately had to switch from 3d controls to 2d controls.
    The limitations of early PS2 era games seemed to work to the atmospheric properties with glitching graphics.
    Nothing actually felt real, and this manages to actually work to the advantage of the game.
    The story, while not entirely clear, has similarities to great novels like Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Dante's Inferno.
    There are also references to Jungian psychology which is rare to see in any work.
    This game does not settle for cheap scares and delivers through atmospheric tension and strong imagery.
    Finally, the multiple endings makes the actions taken by the player meaningful.

    A great Frank Capra film that does not bore despite its age.
    In addition to being a decent comedic romance film, it also manages to make some commentary on social classes.

    On a technical level, this is superior to the original in every way.
    Hair behaves like hair when it is not stylized, water has accurate reflections, and materials have correct specularity and texture.
    Storywise, the novelty of the concept is not quite as high, but this is both a good superhero film as well as a family drama.
    The 70's silver age feel is still there, and the story continues right where the first film ended.
    This runs longer compared to other Pixar films with the runtime straying closer to 2 hours rather than the usual 90-100 minutes.
    This is not Pixar's best, but I think most people will enjoy it, and it is consistent with other Pixar films in terms of quality.

  explanation: >
    This is a hard book to read and a book that is somewhat boring.
    While the topic of whaling in the 1800's can be interesting, the level of detail and ramblings on what I would consider to be insignificant really hurt the general pacing in my opinion.
    The narrator Ishmael is uninteresting and is only there to tell the story and act as a vehicle for some of Melville's opinions.
    There is not much of a plot here, and the main draw is in its details and characters.
    While there is a lot of thought placed into the content, what Moby Dick offers would be equivalent to if Star Wars suddenly went on a tangent and started focusing on the rocket science behind the space ships that show up in the film.
    In my opinion, this had an interesting beginning and a good end, but everything in between (which constitutes the majority of the novel) was tedious to read.
    Interestingly enough, I do think the structure of the novel might make for a good game with Moby Dick being a good final boss.

    While it may not be entirely historically accurate, this has its moments that were thoroughly entertaining, moments that were funny, and moments with momentum.
    It is also not all that preachy and delivers its message without being overbearing.
    While it may suffer from pacing issues and could be trimmed down to make a tighter film, this is a Spike Lee film that is worth watching and is very relevant to modern events.

    This is a unique, mature work that is very different from other works in the genre.

    World building is handled very well with a thorough exploration of Hole where humans live and the sorcerors that use the humans as human test subjects for practicing magic.
    Dialogue is well written, and characters are memorable due to the unique setting and general outlandish nature of the story.
    The source material was said to be impossible to adapt into an anime, but I consider this to be a success that disproves the claim.

    A full coverage of all applications of integrals and integration theory.
    This covers physics, probability theory, statistics and the relations between the two fields which is often overlooked.
    Some of this is review, but I don't think I've ever seen the concepts explained this well.
    It also provides a good progression from moving from univariate to multivariate cases through the Fubini theorem and finally applying them.
    Overall, this makes many university lectures seem amateurish at best.
    I would like to take a look at other entries in this series, but would like to gain a better understanding of physics and chemistry first.

    An imperfect, but engaging movie that introduces gun-fu and dual wielding pistols to film.
    The story is one regarding organized crime and redemption.

    Emulated on PCSX2 and upscaled to 1440p.
    Despite Hideo Kojima being involved in this, this is not a philosophical game or even one with a particularly interesting story.
    There are some references made to ancient Egyptian mythology, but this seems to be more for the purpose of stylization.
    The gameplay is tight, but it lacks depth and variety. The player is given a variety of weapons, but enemies tend to be the same, and enemy AI is rather unsophisticated.
    For cutscenes, due to this being an earlier PS2 title, the graphics are lacking, but the main weakness is relatively bad voice acting and badly written dialogue.
    I wish I played this in the original Japanese version, but finding a Japanese rom for a legacy game console is easier said than done.
    The main strengths here are the soundtrack and the art and mech design which seems to have been done by Yoji Shinkawa.
    I felt like this had potential, but it didn't really live up to my expectations.
    Mech games aside, I've seen similar aesthetics and settings in the animated feature films that probably influenced the art direction for this game.
    That said, I am open to playing the sequel which I have been told is supposedly better in all aspects.

    This is a great minimalist film that leveraged Tom Hardy's acting to create a story with ups and downs that all take place during a drive.
    Dialogue is realistic, and the way in which phone calls progress the narrative is creative.
    Tom Hardy has always been consistently great in all his films and this film is no exception.
    Cinematography and music is simplistic, but this only serves to emphasize the acting.
    Locke is one of those films like Twelve Angry Men that shows what can be done with a limited budget and a simple premise, and it knocks it out of the park.

    Although Wim Hof is a proponent of a breathing technique, his unclear explanations and weaknesses in English make it difficult to narrow down what exactly is happening.
    This interview with James Nestor clears things up and also provides explanations on the topics such as asthma, the impact of breathing on bone structure, the benefits of CO2, and the impact of nose breathing vs mouth breathing.

    This is a great film and differs from Bombay in that it does not have a narrative or a message.
    It just shows what happened.
    In many ways, this is more like a documentary and is similar to other great films like The Battle of Algiers or Zero Dark Thirty.
    It also does not portray either side as right or wrong, and shows the flaws of both the investigators and the perpetrators of the bombings that followed the riots.
    Not only is this a good film, but I think it can be used as an educational tool due to its somewhat unbiased nature.

  explanation: >
    This is not a game, it is more like interactive fiction.
    Its strengths lie in its art and music.
    The music is great which is to be expected because it was composed by Kevin Penkin who worked on Made in Abyss.
    The story itself is somewhat standard and covers a relationship from beginning to end, but it does not get melodramatic or make any mistakes.
    From a critical perspective, this is a good game, but for those who are expecting more from their games than a story (like gameplay with more depth), this may disappoint.
    That said, I think this can appeal to a wide group of people and the short playtime makes it worth a try.

    This is free to play, and despite being a short game, it is one worth playing.
    Apparently this is inspired by Tibetan theology and philosophy.
    While I did come out of this not learning much about Tibetan theology, the art and sound direction do evoke feelings of spirituality.
    The closest game to this is Journey, but unlike Journey, this has less of a narrative.
    It is more minimalist, and this works to the advantage of the game.
    Overall, this is rather impressive for a game developed by a team of four.

    This is a hard hitting game that covers the purgatory of PTSD.
    This is also one of the few games I know of that allows players to commit war crimes and offers a criticism of the US military without needing to explicitly do so outside of text on the loading screen later in the single player campaign.
    The script is well written, and the development of the characters is well done.
    Although the story is based off of Heart of Darkness, it manages to add a layer of psychology to the story to give it a twist.
    There is a level of meta narrative here that places it in a category of its own that groups it with films like Inception.
    The setting of Dubai where water is the new oil acts as its own character and reflects the mentality of its characters.
    There are not many games that handle story telling in the way this game does, and the lack of acclaim definitely makes it underrated.

    This is one of Mani Ratnam's best, and it's emotional impact is probably the highest out of all of his works.
    On a technical level, this is comparable to Dil Se, and the camera is never needlessly static as we see in some of Ratnam's other works.
    There is a dynamism to the camera work and it helps tremendously.
    Music by Rahman with its Islamic influences is very memorable.
    The way in which this film not only tackles interfaith marriages, but uses that as a way to highlight aspects of the Bombay riots was cleverly done.
    This is heavy in imagery, the dialogue is simple but to the point, and the acting is powerful.
    As is typical with many of these Tamil films that take place outside of south India, more Tamil is spoken than is realistic, but I think that can easily be forgiven.

    This is the second game developed by Fullbright after Gone Home.
    Like Gone Home, this is an exploration style game that is short in duration.
    This time, the story takes place on an orbital station, and involves piecing together events that happened using an AI interface.
    The general design of the station and story are well done, but the short duration seemed to lessen the impact of any reveals.
    Finally, the idea of retrieving AI data through an AR interface does not make much sense.

  explanation: >
    This is the first film I saw with Amitabh Bachchan and the first film I saw that used Hindustani instead of just Hindi as its language.
    This is a fairly solid movie, but much of its appeal was lost on me.
    The reason for this is because it seemed to copy from westerns like Magnificent Seven, and Once Upon a Time in the West without improving upon those films in a significant way.
    While those films had signature soundtracks and camera work, this film seemed to be a bit lacking and simplistic in comparison.
    One thing to note is that the restored HD version has a few gimmicks that were intended to be used for 3D viewing, and it is noticeable in that it seems to distract from the actual contents of the film-- whenever there is an explosion, it is pretty much always guaranteed that there is some cgi object flying out towards the camera. 
    That said, I do have a similar reaction when I see Star Wars films nowadays, so it's not too surprising that I wasn't all that caught up with the style of this film that is so clearly designed for mass appeal.

  explanation: >
    Played using PCSX2 without upscaling with the software renderer.
    This is supposedly the best that the Ace Combat series has to offer, and while it is a great game, it is very much a product of its time and a remaster or remake would be very much appreciated.
    There are no drones, the planes are older models, and the graphics are representative of early PS2 graphics complete with dithering.
    Consequently, there is a limited simulation of atmospheric conditions with no condensation, icing or wind taken into account.
    That said, the story is grounded, the concept of anti-asteroid railgun system known as Stonehenge was innovative, and the fictional universe known as Strangereal felt very much like our own.
    The ability to hear the radio chatter of both allies and the enemy makes for a very immersive experience and is probably one of its largest strengths.
    The dogfights were intense and enemies use techniques that are common in dogfighting even today.
    The missions made sense in the context of a larger military conflict and the way in which you play an active role and affect the flow of battle is very well done.
    This is not an easy game. There is a learning curve, but once an understanding of missile systems and dogfighting techniques is reached, it pays off.

    A continuation of Half Life 2.
    There are no new mechanics introduced, so it's really more of the same.
    This is not necessarily a negative, but one thing to note is that the huge changes scene between Half Life 1 and Half Life 2 are not seen here.
    We see the return of the gravity gun, but we don't see Gordon Freeman's signaturue crowbar until the middle of the game.
    Alyx as an AI controlled partner was surprisingly tolerable.
    Overall, it's good, but nothing compared to Half Life 2.

    This is Al Pacino at his best, and I would consider this role to be one of his most defining.

    This has received quite a bit of critical praise, but I feel like what was great about it as lost on me.
    Scenes tend to be rich and oppulent, and Shah Rukh Khan plays an NRI returning home like he does in pretty much most of his films.
    The plot is unimpressive. It has elements that can be found in Sophoclean or Shakesperean plays, but the way in which events lead to other events seem hamfisted at best.
    Motivations for characters are underdeveloped, and the flowery language and interesting shots can't really save it in my eyes.

    This is rough around the edges, but it was made by mostly one person, so that can be forgiven.
    The art is not that great, and the voice acting is cheesy.
    This can work because it is partly satirical, but it's hard to tell when to take the content matter seriously.
    That said, this is a very detailed work with a lot of thought put into it although the writing does seem amateurish at times.
    From a sci-fi perspective, this is probably the only work that gets as into the details as books I've read in the genre by William Gibson or Neal Stephenson.
    This makes it very impressive because it is difficult to get across that level of detail in a game.
    The music is very reminiscent of Blade Runner, but it isn't a cheap immitation and uses elements like dialup tones, static, and gunshots to add texture.
    In addition to this, this manages to move genre tropes forward by introducing concepts like unilaterally assured destruction as an evolution of mutually assured destruction or weaponizin parallel timelines.
    This makes this a very unique game, and I don't think I've seen anything like it even when I compare it with other cyberpunk games.

    Covers mental deficiencies like dyslexia and how it can go untreated within the Indian education system.
    An interesting thing I noticed is how Indian education seems to be leaning towards processing a large number of students as quickly as possible like a factory.
    Unfortunately, it seems like this is the trend for education at all levels in many parts of the world due to increasing population, so it is questionable whether students who have certain deficiencies will receive the specialized care that they need.

    Cinematography and overall direction make it seem more like a classic film from the 70's or 80's rather than something out the 90's, and the different locations used make it hard to tell when the movie takes place.

    This movie is to Mani Ratnam what The Aviator was to Martin Scorsese, and solidifies my impression of Mani Ratnam as India's Martin Scorsese.
    This film is not Mani Ratnam's best, but the depiction of a developing India and Turkey was very interesting to see.
    This film has a certain intense momentum in parts of the story that can suck you in, and it would have been nice if the story was written to emphasize those parts.
    Abhishek Bachchan's performance as the businessman Gurukant Desai was intense and just great, making him the centerpiece of the film.
    Other than Madhavan, who managed to hold his own, other actors were either good or just adequate in comparson.
    The score by A.R. Rahman was great, but the individual songs were good but unimpressive compared to his more memorable works.
    Editing lacked subtlety and is probably the weakest part of the film due to it being more flashy than it needed to be.

    This is like Roja without the political backdrop.
    When compared to Dil Se, this is the opposite in that it has clearly good writing, acting, but a smaller budget and scale.
    In this film, the cinematography is conducted by P. C. Sriram instead of Santosh Sivan and as a result, there are some clear differences in the shots.
    With regards to Mani Ratnam's previous work, the director innovates this time by using an anachronistic structure which is not often used in films in general.
    In addition to this, this offers a realistic depiction of married life.
    While I prefer Mani Ratnam's works that feature a larger scale, this is a good film with decent cinematography and features some memorable tracks by A.R. Rahman.

    This is one of the highest rated Indian films in Imdb.
    This is also one of the few sports films that focuses on women.
    Aamir Khan's acting in this one is probably the best out of all the films of his I have seen so far.
    Cinematography is also very good.
    I think the plot was not all that ground breaking, but despite that, this executes well on all aspects.
    Scenes involving wrestling clearly involve a great deal of technique and physicality and it was impressive to see the actors deliver on that.
    This is one of those films that does nothing wrong and is well executed.

    The music is great, the cinematography is great, the acting and script are debatable.
    The main character would be categorized as a stalker by today's standards.
    In older Islamic stories, this type of behavior may be considered normal, but when you place such as story in a modern setting, it becomes a conflicting point.
    This is what prevents this from being a great film in my opinion.
    Acting also seems to be overdone by SRK and the melodrama seems to have removed any subtlety from the picture.
    That said, for Mani Ratnam's first Hindi film, this is a good achievement, and the film seems very modern in terms of technical achievements.
    In terms of songs, I think this also one of AR Rahman's best works.
    This film also covers the topic of liberationists which many in the west may not know about India.
    While it may not be a perfect film, it has iconic moments, and is worth watching despite the long runtime.

    This is a road trip style comedy drama that has good cinematography.
    Out of all the Indian films I have seen so far, this is the least Indian film I have seen.
    The film takes place in Spain, the music breaks are not as abrupt as other films, and the general style seems very western.
    It presents philosophies about life through experiences on the trip and does a lot of "show don't tell".
    The way scenes of diving, skydiving and Encierro were filmed puts you in the moment.
    That said, the skydiving was somewhat unrealistic, because free fall does not last as long as they show in the film.
    I went into this with no expectations and came out impressed.

  explanation: >
    This is the first film that A.R. Rahman scored and you can tell because of the heavy use of synths.
    Roja is a very different film from Nayakan in terms of story despite both being directed by Mani Ratnam.
    This film borrows from the Mahabharatha making it a very strange film in terms of how its story plays out due to it not using completely modern conventions in its story telling.
    Cinematography is as good if not better than Nayakan.
    One thing that seems fairly obvious is that Mani Ratnam is not used to filming action and stuntwork seems amateurish.
    The political backdrop is one of the strengths of this film, and offers some context that grounds the older origins of the story in modern times.
    Overall, this is a good film that showcases Mani Ratnam's unique style.
    One thing to note is that English subtitles are mostly accurate, but do not appear to be direct translations, so some level of nuance is lost in the translation process.

    Ashutosh Gowariker and A.R. Rahman team up again to create another great film after Lagaan.
    This is also the first film I saw with Shah Rukh Khan in it.
    This time, the scale is smaller, but the writing and cinematography is better.
    Instead of historical India, this takes place in modern times and focuses on societal problems, poverty, and traditionalism.
    The concept of an NRI is explaiend and explored.
    There is a good visualization of a hydro electric turbine as well as shots taken at NASA during the space shuttle program.
    The GPM system mentioned in the film was an actual system that was developed and launched in 2014, which I found interesting.
    Overall, this is solid, and does not get boring at all.

  explanation: >
    Despite this having some cliches, this is a very novel and original story.
    Like many Indian films, this is a long one and comes complete with an intermission.
    I doubt that most people watch it through in one sitting.
    It is also a good way to get introduced to the rules and convensions of cricket.
    I don't think I've seen a movie about cricket and I don't think I've seen a good historical sports film that did not involve boxing or running.
    The mixture of Hindi and English make this accessible to a western audience despite some of the music breaks, which are less abrupt compared to other films.
    The classic story of an underdog is well done and characters are unique which helps the unique setting of the story.
    Acting is good, and cinematography is occasionally great, but usually mediocre.
    The setup is flawed, but the actual cricket match towards the end is very entertaining.
    Overall, this is a great film.

  explanation: >
    One of my goals when I learn Mandarin is to be able to quote the Analects from memory.
    This is a good initial step towards that goal, but it also allows for a deeper understanding of east Asian culture.
    This holds many similarities to some of Plato's works and some of the Greek works that were written during the same time.
    There are conversations between characters and anecdotes about certain characters as examples of certain principles that are emphasized in The Analects.
    The majority of this book is about this character (usually Confucius) saying a certain thing or another character saying something else.
    Filial piety, propriety, the branches of learning, the mandate of heaven, and other concepts that were tested within the imperial examination in ancient China are all here.
    There are many things here that, by modern standards, will seem sexist or contradictory.
    Overall, like many older works, this has its flaws and should be read critically.

    This is a good, but imperfect movie. Camerawork is way more shaky than is necessary.
    The Apollo mission was pretty accurate. It matched what I saw in archival footage.
    Although not historically accurate in every sense, it manages to tell a good story by dramatizing parts of Neil Armstrong's life despite his life already being somewhat dramatic.
    There are some good shots in here, but this is not Damien Chazelle's best work and it did seem like he was out of his element working in a non-music related film.

    I thought the series ended with the second movie, but then they made a third one and then a fourth one.
    The third one felt like a decent conclusion, but this fourth did not feel like that at all.
    Donnie Yen was good as always and Scott Adkins did well as the antagonist.
    As is typical in these types of movies, foreign influences act as an oppressor of Chinese endeavors.
    The writing felt weak in this one, but the technical quality is consistent with previous films.
    Choreography is good, cinematography is decent and Kenji Kawaii's score is good as always.

    I think this is the first non-Chinese and non-American martial arts biopic I've seen.

    In addition to that, I think this is the first film I've seen that covers the perspective of Zainichi Koreans.

    The concept of online counseling as a way to accumulate a corpus that can be used to train a general intelligence is original despite the concept of online counseling not being an economically scaleable business in the form that was presented in the game.
    There is also some coverage of the debates regarding psychology and psychotherapy as a rigorous field of study.

    This is a movie that keeps giving and giving.
    The behavior of zombies can be inconsistent at times, but other than that, this is a tight film that knows what it is doing.

  explanation: >
    Like all Final Fantasy games, this is quite a time investment.
    In terms of how this compares to other games, this is probably the best executed, but also the safest game.
    What I mean by safe is that there is nothing particularly groundbreaking here.
    It does what has already been done in previous games in the series, but better.
    It is for this reason that I actually prefer FFVII over this.
    In terms of graphics, this improves upon FFVII. Characters no longer look blocky, and FMV's look like something out of a painting.
    This game has actually aged quite well.
    Conversely, the music is not as great as other games. That is not to say that the music is bad, but I found it lacking for a Final Fantasy game despite a great main theme.
    Battle mechanics are also fairly standard.
    Finally, the world feels less fleshed out and smaller compared to other entries.
    Despite this, I felt that the story was on par with more ambitious entries despite it not being quite that detailed due to the main characters.
    All things said, this was probably my least favorite out of all the Final Fantasy games I have played up to this point, but when I heard the main Final Fantasy theme come on during the end credits like the Disney theme comes on at the beginning of a Disney film, I felt fairly satisfied.

    This was way better than I was expecting it to be and I was pleasantly surprised.
    Writing is mature and dialogue is smooth.
    Action and animation is simplistic compared to the state of the art during the time, but the images and backgrounds compensate.
    The city of Gotham looks like something that came out of the 1940's, and this adds to the atmosphere.
    While watching this, I could not help but compare this to black and white noir films from the late 30's and 40's which reflects the high quality of the work.
    Overall, this is a solid Batman film that thoroughly explores the motivations of its main character.

  explanation: >
    While the contents of this book may be considered novel from a western standpoint, it uses a lot of common tropes that show up in Chinese webnovels.
    This is a book that takes place in an alternate reality where certain events haven't occured.
    This allows for the main character of Zhang Ye to introduce popular books and shows from the original reality to become famous.
    In addition to this, the book uses a system mechanic that shows up in other Chinese novels to add to the the novelty of the story.
    In many ways, this is a book about wish fulfillment.
    The main character becomes a jack of all trades that stands at the top of China all because he has knowledge from the original reality and a system that gives him game-like bonuses.
    This can get old quickly, but it is very satisfying if you are willing to suspend disbelief.
    In my opinion, the biggest strength of this novel is its thorough overview of Chinese culture.
    This novel covers famous books and movies and people that have been influential in China while also covering what foreign works have been of greatest influence in the domestic market.
    There is also a decent coverage of differing cultures across the different provinces of China.
    While it may not be worth reading all 1600+ chapters that were written before it was discontinued, I would say that the first 600 chapters are entertaining.

  explanation: >
    This film is considered iconic among Cantonese films, and while it has its moments, it is also imperfect.
    Part of this is culturual.
    There are abrupt shifts from comedy to serious moments, and a western audience will most likely view this as a weakness despite it being rather common within Hong Kong films.
    I feel that if it focused more on the gambling and action and less on the comedy, it might have functioned better.
    The beginning and the end are great, but the middle is not in my opinion, and the usage of a head injury as a cause of amnesia is somewhat cliche.
    It is not a bad film, but it is on the border between an average film and a good one.

    Although this is inferior to Steins;Gate, but is still a good series.
    This series builds upon the events of Steins;Gate by analyzing an alternate world line that did not have the same ending in Steins;Gate.
    In this timeline, World War III will still happen, and the gimick of AI is presented as a way for people to achieve some form of immortality.
    The strengths of this series lies in its abilities to take the mechanics introduced in Steins;Gate and expand upon them to flesh out the futures and pasts that were hinted at in Steins;Gate.
    Overall, it does not do anything particularly new when compared to the original Steins;Gate, but it manages to use time travel to tell a compelling story that drags at the beginning, but picks up later on.

    I consider the second part to be better than the first because part two seems to play to the strengths of the source material, and build off of the events in part one.
    We finally see the appearance familiar characters such as Monkey and Pig, and a reasonable conclusion to the story.
    The fight between the Monkey King and Bull Demon King was well done.
    With more modern works, typically CGI would be used for the more nonsensical aspects of Journey to the West, but this film uses practical effects which I felt added to the quality.
    Overall, I found it to be creative and thought it was one of the few films that manages to successfully mix tragedy and comedy.

    It's not as bad as people say it is, but it isn't a good movie. Special effects and the score are great, acting is fine.
    Writing is seriously flawed, and pacing and editing are rather bad.
    Typically, in Star Wars movies, the point is to tell a story, but here it seems like the writers were just trying to work through a checklist and get from point A to point B.
    There are many contradictions, hanging threads, plot holes, unexplained motivations, and inconsistencies with previous films.
    Transitions between scenes are abrupt and horribly handled.

    This is a film that is directed by Jeffrey Lau, but it stars Stephen Chow.
    This film, like many Stephen Chow films, brings in Man-Tat Ng to add Mo Lei Tau style comedy to the story.
    A Chinese Odyssey is based on Journey to the West, but this is a reimagining of the story from the perspective of the Monkey King rather than a retelling of the Ming dynasty classic.
    Some of the comedy and plot will not make sense if you don't have some familiarity with Journey to the West and Chinese culture beforehand.
    This film drags at the beginning, but improves towards the end.
    Overall, it is a good film, but execution is not the best.
    Acting and comedy is fine, but pacing and special effects do seem a little bit lacking from a western perspective.

    Although the film focuses on television, the general messages apply, perhaps even more so, to how people consume information today.
    While I was not a fan of the cinematography, the story is tight and well scripted.

    This is a great example of Stephen Chow's talents and Hong Kong's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_lei_tau" target="_blank">Mo Lei Tau</a> style of comedy.
    When watching this, it is clear why Jackie Chan broke through to the international stage while Stephen Chow did not.
    Jackie Chan is a martial artist that dabbles in comedy while Stephen Chow is a comedian that dabbles in martial arts.
    Because of this, the word play and cultural references in Stephen Chow's works don't translate as well.
    That said, if you are familiar with Hong Kong culture and Chinese scholarship in general, you will find that this is a smartly written film that has something for the literate as well as the common people.
    There is a nice mixture of classical poetry, Chinese opera tropes with modern references that I've never seen in western cinema and was very rare in mainland Chinese films during the time.
    If you are looking to understand Cantonese a little better or just have an interest in historical Chinese figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Yin" target="_blank">Tong Pak Fu</a> this will satisfy your needs.

    The most mentally challenging game that I ever played.
    The puzzles were difficult and were challenging despite the commonality of drawing lines.
    The philosophy and message of the game flew over my head in a way that I've only see happen in Shane Carruth films.
    For many, this can be hit or miss due to the lack of a narrative and the difficulty and abundance of puzzles.
    Despite this, I found the imagery, use of Feng Shui and Zen Buddhist ideas in combination with western philosophy and poetry to be very original.
    This is not a game that you speed through. This is a game that takes months to complete with frequent breaks away from the screen.
    While some of the puzzles can be brute forced, it is recomended that you focus more on pattern recognition unless you are an extremely patient person.

    I don't remember the last time I saw a Bollywood film if ever.
    There was also a lot more English in this film than I was expecting which was a surprise.
    This is a film that I think will appeal almost universally to the general audience and be received a little bit more mildly although positively by film critics.
    One thing to note is that since it is a Bollywood film, it is very long, people will teleport to random places and start singing, and there will be instances of somewhat overacted melodrama.
    That said, the main themes of the film such as friendship, purpose and education along with its humor and wit allow for it to be easily relatable.
    There are many things that I did find to be rather fascinating from a cultural perspective.
    I did not realize engineers were a big deal in India, and I did not realize that instructors had as much authority as they did in educational institutions.
    The closest thing I can think of to this is attitudes towards education in mainland China.

  explanation: >
    The initial premise was similar to a short story I wrote years ago except my story was from the perspective of the supervisors and not the natives of the planet.
    Childhood's End is a different take on the first contact story where the aliens have a special plan for humanity and help humanity despite not revealing their intentions.
    It is one part science fiction and one part mystery where the reader is learning of how humanity society can be improved into something more utopian while at the same time losing certain freedoms.
    The third act is probably the best part of the book despite its abstractness.
    Concepts regarding cosmic level intelligences and the evolution of life into something more formless draws from not only Greek philosophy, but also gave similar impressions as what one may experience when reading H.P. Lovecraft.
    Overall, this is an entertaining read.
    The only large complaint I might have is one that I have with other Western science fiction which is that characters seem to only be instruments to move plot forward.

    I remember watching Stalker many years ago and falling asleep in the middle of it (I still liked the movie though).
    Unlike Stalker, Roadside Picnic seemed easier to follow and denser in content despite lacking some of the philosophy that Andrei Tarkovsky was known for.
    Also, in Roadside Picnic, they actually explain what caused the creation of the zone.
    In Stalker, I was convinced that it had something to do with nuclear power, but in Roadside Picnic, it was clarified that the cause was aliens.
    The concept of the zone as a sort of Bermuda triangle on land is highly original.
    This is a short read, but it has interesting ideas. I'd like to play the games that were based off of this next if I have the time.

    I don't play a lot of flash games nowadays, but Caravaneer is such a unique series that I find myself returning to this work every once in a while.
    This is an unforgiving and long game, but if you use hacks like ArcadePreHacks, you can fly through the game and enjoy the story.
    Caravaneer 2 is a game that is heavy on story and manages to successfully build a post apocalyptic world set years after the entire world got turned into a desert.
    You have the opportunity to be a merchant and take advantage of changing economies.
    You can take part in politics and change how different factions interact with each other.
    There are many similarities to Fallout, but unlike the Fallout series, this seems to have a better thought out story and it feels like your actions actually have some weight despite its significantly lower budget and scale.
    I would like to see a sequel make it onto Steam, because it would be a shame for games like this fade into obscurity with the rest of the flash games.

    I think the last time I saw something with puppets was either Thunderbolt Fantasy or Sesamstraat.
    I don't know why they decided to use puppets, but it seems to work and effectively allows for the film to use more practical effects.
    This gives it somewhat of an 80's feel.
    Despite all that, I would consider this to be a unique, above average comedy.
    It seems to mix subtlety and over the top comedy to create an interesting commentary on the war on terror, American foreign policy, activist actors, and geopolitics.
    In spite of this, the issues are dated, making it difficult for viewers from a younger generation to fully appreciate the jokes.
    The best part of this film are the songs.
    The puppetry is not that sophisticated.
    The movie is aware of this, and pokes fun at the puppetry.

  explanation: >
    The most in depth interview with Elon Musk that I have seen so far.
    It covers his entire life and is not afraid to get very technical.
    This interview hits many different areas such as finance, management, programming, manufacturing, materials science, and physics.
    It is a good video to remind you how engineers should approach problems and how technological progress should be conducted.
    I wish there was more on Neuralink, AI, and maybe even a little more on rocket technology, but there are other interviews and talks you can watch that more than make up for the deficiencies of this video.

    An overview of Pytorch that not only covers the library, but also the general deep learning workflow.
    This explains what tensors are, different loss functions, as well as how to create forward and backward functions.
    It also explains activation functions like RELU.
    Comparisons and differences between Pytorch and Tensorflow are covered.

  explanation: >
    This is a book that covers the top 20 most spoken languages.
    While I don't like how information is presented, it does the job, and it provides useful information for any aspiring polyglots.
    Each language is given its own chapter, but what is discusssed for each language varies. Some chapters discuss words and grammar while other discuss culture and history.
    This inconsistency is what I find to be the largest problem with this book, but if you can get past that, you might find it to be palatable.
    One thing I appreciated was its coverage of loan words.
    It made it easier determine an order in which to learn languages based on which languages were influenced by others.
    E.g., learning Chinese before Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese, or learning Arabic before learning Persian, Turkish, Swahili and Hindi.

  explanation: >
    The cinematography in this film is its strongest point and it is all due to the skills of Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes.
    There are not many weak points in this film other than its premise.
    The attention to detail and the ambitious nature of the long takes makes it a film to be studied like Birdman and Rope.
    Every second of this film felt real and highly immersive.
    This is one of the few films I can think of that could actually be improved with a higher frame rate.
    In terms of WWI films, I consider this to be better than Paths of Glory.
    In terms of verisimilitude, the entirety of this film is comparable to the D-day sequence in Saving Private Ryan.
    In terms of quality, I'd say it is neck and neck with Saving Private Ryan where Saving Private Ryan had better character development and 1917 had better action and technical milestones.
    It is that great and it makes a strong case for more WWI movies.

  explanation: >
    A playlist of videos that make the mathematics of machine learning far more accessible.
    Granted, you don't know machine learning if you don't know how to use matrix representations of the concepts, but it is a good way to have a conceptual understanding of classifiers, regression, and other techniques.
    I'm not a big fan of the presentation style, and the videos tend to be towards the longer side, but I think that this is one of the better resources on Youtube for machine learning.
    This seems to lack certain concepts like Bayesian approaches, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and Laplacian point estimation which is unfortunate, but it is a good starting point.
    I would have also liked to have seen more on how to optimize hyperparameters, as well as a gradual progression into more mathematical representations of the concepts.
    This might be good for a programmer who just wants to know how the apply the concepts, but if you are in academia and are trying to do research, write a paper, or study for an exam, this is lacking.
    That said, resources for ML on youtube are either limited or lacking in pedagogical quality, so most people will need to settle for this.

    Unlike the Russel and Norvig textbook, this is more of a speculative book that fouses more on what may be possible rather than the current technology.
    It analyzes and extrapolates what may happen in the future as AI improves and how society and the human race will change as a result.
    It compares and contrasts many different scenarios. Overall, it is well thought out and well researched.
    There are many references to other works that I read such as Thinking Fast and Slow, Homo Deus, Sapiens, I Robot, etc.
    Overall, I found it to be a serious treatment of the field that was grounded in reality and tried to provide possible guidelines in terms of how to think about the technology.

  explanation: >
    I now use this in place of meditation because playing this game at high speeds allows me to easily enter the zone.
    This game is one of the best games I have ever played and it proves that the Tetris Effect is real.
    The game of Tetris is simple, but in combination with the sensory stimuli and effects powered by Unreal Engine 4 allows me to reach altered states very quickly.
    Although it does make players enter the zone, it does not do this artificially.
    You will actually become a decent Tetris player by the end of the journey mode if you play in normal or expert difficulty.
    I have never had a game do anything like this to me ever.
    It is imperfect, but the flaws can easily be improved.
    If speeds and difficulty can be adjusted as the player plays, this can allow for altered states to be entered far more quickly.
    A larger variety of music tracks and visuals would also be appreciated.
    Finally, if the game can take in biometric data like heart rate into account, I think it may be possible to do things other than just enter the zone.
    Highly recommended not only to gamers, but to everyone.
    I think this has therapeutic aspects that can be very <a href="https://youtu.be/7T7mg6JZZzg" target="_blank">useful</a>.
    I would really like to try this with VR if I get the chance.

    The last film I saw on my Delta flight to Amsterdam.
    This one was above average, but it had holes.
    Character motivations seemed contradictory at times, but it was definitely thought provoking.
    The concept of a machine raising a child is something that isn't covered very much in fiction.
    Many ideas are presented, but I would have liked to have seen the exploration of a single idea at greater depth.
    It felt as though it were trying to tackle many themes at once, and I felt that weakened the film as a whole.
    It may be just me, but I feel that as I learn more about AI, the films about the subject don't seem to hold up with the most recent literature.

    It has been a while since I've seen an indie film with a low budget.
    Jim Cummings absolutely nails it not only with his directing, but with his acting as well.
    He singlehandedly sells the film and the long duration shots that had him really flex his acting chops made the film something special.
    I didn't seem to be the intended audience of this film with its themes of divorce, fatherhood, and loss.
    There were awkward moments in there due to the mix of comedy and heavy drama, but somehow Jim manages to make it work.

    This shows exactly what happened during the Apollo 11 mission and nothing else.
    There is no extraneous narration and all footage was footage taken during the mission.
    Picture quality is great, and you feel like you are experiencing exactly what the world experienced when the mission happened.
    It blows my mind that some of the sequences and shots they had were actually taken during the time of the mission.
    I didn't realize they had the technology for some of the techniques that were utilized at the time.

  explanation: >
    This is like a cyberpunk Uber simulator.
    Most of the game plays out like a sophisticated visual novel that takes place within a car.
    Concepts like automated driving vs human drivers, automation, quantum decryption and AI are touched upon.
    The emotions of the main character and the navigation of complicated conversations and social situations like handling gaslighting are well done.
    For an indie title, it is solid, but as a game, it is lacking in details.
    The world outside the cab feels almost desolate. You don't feel as though you are in a large city.
    It's a low budget game, so assets had to be kept to a minimum but additional details would have made it way better.
    I'm not asking for high graphical fidelity, but a more realistic world.

  explanation: >
    This one got better critical acclaim than it did with general audiences.
    I think I can understand why.
    Ad Astra is an introspective film that takes place in space.
    Unlike Interstellar or Gravity, this focuses more on relationships and seems to be deliberate and comparatively minimalistic.
    Other similar films focus more on action and suspense.
    Rather than comparing with more modern space films, this should be compared with Solyaris or 2001: A Space Odyssey.
    If you want a succint summary, this feels like a cross between Solyaris, 2001, and Apocalypse Now.
    That sounds like a pretty good combination to me.
    The focus is on character and cinematography, and I feel that it succeeds in that respect.
    In addition to this, while it is not completely realistic, it does seem real enough to seem possible.
    Similar to 2001, Ad Astra also hints at what commercial space travel and tourism might look like and it is very convincing.
    Overall, I feel that it is highly underrated and that we need more films like this in the genre.

    It draws from the exaggerations made in old western dime novels.

  explanation: >
    This reminded me of Studio Ghibli films like Nausicaa and Howl's Moving Castle.
    Like Nausicaa, there is a post apocalyptic steampunk aspect to this, and like Howl's Moving Castle, there is the aspect of controlling a large machine by running around and manually adjusting different things.
    Unlike some other games where you are the only character, this one has an exaggerated feeling of isolation because the setting makes you feel as though it is at least populated by other people.
    In that sense, it is somewhat similar to Machinarium.
    Far: Lone Sails also has a similar ambience.
    Like many others in the genre, it is a short and simple but satisfying.

    3Blue1Brown has the best animations and graphical representations, but this seems to have the best presentation of the topic in an engaging way.
    Khan Academy seems boring and long winded in comparison to this.
    This actually has thorough coverage of applications and does not merely present the abstract details.
    In addition to this, videos are short and compact.
    I think this is an underrated series given the high quality.
    I would have liked more details on eigenvalues, but I watched this for decent coverage of matrix algebra, so it served its task.
    If I have time, I'd like to view the next volume since that has Lagrange Multipliers, calculation of Nash Equilibrium and some coverage of linear regression which is very useful in machine learning.

  explanation: >
    P.T. is short for playable teaser. This was directed and designed by Hideo Kojima in collaboration with Guillermo Del Toro.
    Since I don't own a Ps4 and P.T. is no longer downloadable, I had to watch a playthrough instead which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/bjDmGGtglEY" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Compared to other games, this one is far more stripped down and has a very simple level design.
    The game is organized in an infinite loop where you explore different variations of the same floor over and over again.
    It was very surreal and very M.C. Escher"esque".
    Get rid of the colors, and you might have something close to Eraserhead.
    I did not know what to make of it.
    Any narrative was told through a radio and weird messages that show up on the walls of the building.
    As a game, it is lacking, but as a tech demo and teaser, I felt that it was effective.
    I think you have to play it to get the full experience.
    Having someone fly through the puzzles doesn't really allow one to have full appreciation for the game.

    With graduate school, I read a lot regarding learning, uncertainty, reinforcment learning, and a fair amount of the later half of the textbook.
    In my bachelors, I read a decent amount of the first half.
    I think this all adds up to me reading most of this textbook which has about 700+ pages of material.
    Total page count is about 1100 with a large part being exercises, appendixes, summaries and other complementary information typically found in a textbook.
    The Russell, Norvig textbook was written by experts in the field, and the most recent editions have been updated to include more modern techniques and discoveries.
    This is THE book for AI.
    I found this to be well written, but explanations regarding algorithms could have been structured better.
    With this, I have a fairly decent understanding of AI and its limitations.
    If there is one thing I got out of this, it is that we have a long way to go.
    That said, there are some very interesting applications that can be made using current techniques that will still be disruptive.
    We don't necessarily need general AI to accelerate the progress of civilization.
    Modern techniques offer quite a number of possiblities, and it is not necessary to wait for the silver bullet of general AI to discover the potential of AI.

    This game is highly minimalistic and shares many similarities to Journey.
    Similarly, there seems to be some sort of hero's journey, and a mythology that governs the world of Gris.
    Like the art design, the music is also minimal.

  explanation: >
    Based on what I remember of the source material, this film falls short.
    It's not bad, but it's also not good.
    The world in the film is a bit more vibrant and less brutal than the world in Gunm.
    Part of what made the source material so compelling was an idea of hope in the face of desolation and incredible suffering.
    This movie lacks that and all of the philosophical musings that came with it.
    In that sense, the OVA that came out decades ago excels where this fails.
    Technical aspects and acting are well done, but a movie needs to have a compelling story and characters first and foremmost.
    Finally, there were instances where I had flashbacks to Sharkboy and Lavagirl. That should be somewhat telling.
    I don't think Robert Rodriguez's directing style works for this film, but he also has not directed a movie I would consider great within the past 8 years, so maybe I should not be so surprised.

    Sayonara Wild Hearts is an arcade style music game that has a mix of endless runner and shmup style gameplay.
    The visuals are a beautiful mix in the style of outrun and matches the music.
    The music is also very well done with a mixture of synths and vocals.
    Gameplay is dynamic and changes between different modes based on your place in the music.
    It is not overly difficult, and as long as you have average reflexes, you should be able to finish in a short period of time.
    This is not a genre that I am a fan of, but this game's creativity has won me over.

  explanation: >
    Story is not the strong point of the John Wick series and this movie is no exception, but if you came for great action, this movie delivers.
    This is a film that tries not to be smarter than it actually is and just delivers great stunts and set pieces.
    It is stylistic. The editing is not spastic like other lesser action films, and in regards to stunts, they had some of the best in the industry for this one.
    I don't think there was a weak link in terms of acting. No one here will take home an Oscar, but I think everyone did their part well with Keanu Reeves successfully selling his role as John Wick.
    When it comes to action, John Wick 3 is creative, visceral, and it does not cut corners in any way.
    You will see gun fights on horses, incredible usage of trained dogs, and good gunwork.
    It's definitely worth watching.

  explanation: >
    A Story About My Uncle is a platforming game that starts out as a bedtime story.
    The story itself is nothing to write home about and the graphics are unsophisticated.
    So the platforming must be good right?
    It's actually mixed.
    The ideas presented are interesting and the mechanics are used well, but the platforming itself felt unbalanced.
    Hitboxes seemed to not match what was rendered on the screen, and grappling did not seem to follow the laws of physics exactly.
    To put it simply, this game is unpolished, but the short playtime makes the flaws a little less of a problem.

  explanation: >
    Dynasty Warriors 2 was one of the first games I ever played and it is interesting to see how it is in one of its most recent incarnations.
    Graphics are unimpressive, the gameplay is still the same as it was 10 years ago and like most Koei Tecmo games, it is a buggy mess.
    That said, I seemed to have no problems with these things due to nostalgia and my appreciation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
    There is something satisfying about mowing down hundreds of enemies in historical China.
    This installment has more than just the three kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu. It also has a campaign for Jin (the Sima clan) and a campaign for Lu Bu.
    In addition to this, it also has more playable characters and many of the officers are no longer faceless mooks like they were in previous installments.
    I managed to make it through all the campaigns except for Wei and Shu due to those campaigns crashing for me after certain missions.
    So would I recommend it? Not at all. Did I have fun? Yes.

  explanation: >
    I wish this show was around when I was younger. It truly makes me want to reverse engineer everything I see to find out how they work.
    It covers chemistry and its applications in a basic and accessible way in a context where the introduction of scientific ideas isn't forced.
    In addition to that, it offers suggestions on how to rebuild modern human technology starting with a level of technology matchin that of the stone age.
    Dr. Stone is a shounen anime, so it falls into some of the tropes that come with the genre.
    As a result, pacing isn't the best, but it gets better in the second half.
    There are moments in here that have impressed me.
    The idea that you can create a human powered electric generator using stone age technology is something I never would thought of.
    The importance of fire and pinpoint heating helped to explain why humanity took so long to go from the stone age to the iron and bronze ages.
    While there is a requirement for suspension of disbelief, there is quite a bit of science in here that is legitimate.
    This is a show that is rich in ideas. Its execution isn't perfect, but I found it enjoyable.
    I'm looking forward to the next season.

  explanation: >
    This is an addicting sandbox.
    I initially played on survival mode, but switched to creative mode to have a bit more freedom and to save time.
    It was still time consuming despite this, because of the massive underwater world that required hours of exploration.
    I think freedom mode would be the best mode because it would better emphasize the crafting aspect, but if you are not a fan of spending hours farming for resources, creative mode can't be beat.
    The world itself is rather detailed. It has many biomes and large amounts of biodiversersity.
    The unique setting and story provides a background that has a bit of urgency and a lot of wonder.
    This is a well made game that never dragged.

  explanation: >
    Probably the worst movie I saw out of the three on my flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.
    This had the most lazy god awful writing I've witnessed in a long time.
    Dialogue is predictable and I didn't care about any of the characters.
    Aquaman basically took bits and pieces from many superhero films and created a Frankenstein of a film.
    Action scenes were mainly CGI and lacked creativity.
    Before watching this film, I was curious to see how Aquaman could be made interesting.
    After watching this film, I realized that the only redeemable thing about this was Jason Momoa's personality and Nicole Kidman's acting.

    This is a mixed one that had a lot of potential.
    There is some great imagery here.
    Scenes of Earth traveling through space, its atmosphere being swallowed up by Jupiter are absolutely sublime.
    This is despite the CGI looking very fake when compared to films produced by Hollywood.
    The emphasis on people across the world coming together was appreciated.
    Pacing is not that great and the characters suck.
    There are some cliché tropes that show up here.
    If you've seen a Chinese film before, you probably are familiar with certain stereotypes that show up here.
    The premise is interesting albeit rather unrealistic.
    I consider Cixin Liu to be China's Isaac Asimov, but this didn't meet my expectations.

    The story isn't deep. It won't make you shed tears, or make you think.

    Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Jason Statham have good chemistry.

    Watched this at Pathé in standard quality as a way to recover after exams.
    I would have prefered Imax, but availability of Imax screens in the Netherlands is low.
    That said, it was one of the best experiences I had watching in standard quality even though there were Dutch subtitles.
    Joker is the current's generation Taxi Driver and it is easy to forget that it is a comic book film.
    It is operatic, artistic, and often indulgent in nature.
    Similar to a Scorsese film, it values story over plot, but it places less emphasis on dialogue and more emphasis on image.
    It also pays homage to many older films.
    Every frame is beautiful, hypnotizing and most shots seem deliberate.
    The music is dramatic and reminded me of Pink Floyd's The Wall at times.
    Hildur Guðnadóttir is a talented composer and her music reminded me of Jóhann Jóhannsson's work due to its brooding nature.
    It was only afterwards that I realized that Hildur is Icelandic as well.
    In addition to this, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one of his best and rivals Daniel Day-Lewis'  performance in There will be Blood.
    Although there are scenes where it might drag and the movie as a whole is not perfect, I found Joker to be one of those rare films that I will revisit in the future.

  explanation: >
    In terms of hard sci-fi, this show was way better than it had any right to be.
    I don't remember the last time I had my mind blown, but some of the twists and reveals in the second part of this show took me by complete surprise.
    What follows will contain spoilers.
    Kanata no Astra derives its title from the latin phrase Per aspera ad astra. This is where the film Ad Astra also derives its title from.
    The show follows the standard tropes of a Shounen anime, but takes things to the next level with its thoughtful premise.
    Concepts like illegal cloning for the purpose of expanding longevity, revisionism of history, and weaponized wormholes are covered.
    It also includes one of the only representations of an intersex human I have seen in media.
    I wish it would have also included time dilation. It seems like the show played loose with relativity, but this may have allowed for the show to be more accessible for the scientifically illiterate.
    If you are used to genre tropes in Shounen anime and are willing to suspend disbelief, this is definitely worth the time.

  explanation: >
    I am currently reading through A Brief History of Time, so I thought this movie might make a decent companion piece and serve as inspiration for studying.
    This was not the case, because the film is full of historical inaccuracies, and it does not focus on the science.
    This is disappointing because it has great cinematography and a great soundtrack by Jóhann Jóhannsson.
    In addition to this, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones were terrific in their roles.
    One thing people might be confused about coming into this film is that this is a film about Stephen Hawking.
    This is incorrect, because it is based on a memoir by Jane Hawking.
    The film might be better if it focused on Jane Hawking, but it seems to split its attention between Stephen Hawking and Jane Hawking which ultimately degrades the script.
    It is a good film, but it lacks focus.

  explanation: >
    A high level overview of differential equations.
    I did not expect to completely understand everything about differential equations, but this overview gives a sampling platter of topics in the area.
    I wished he covered Fourier Transform pairs, but there is a limit to how much you can cover in a simple overview, and there may be new videos added to the playlist in the future.
    The graphical visualizations of Fourier series were very well done and are a great teaching tool.

    A really short game with less than 2 hours of playtime from beginning to end.
    Within those two hours, it managed to remind me of dreams I had as a child, and the imagination I used to have when I was younger.
    This game successfully captures the story of an entire family while also taking a walking simulator and improving it with alternate perspectives and new approaches to exploration.
    It is an accomplishment to show the beauty of life within two hours, and the only other games I can think of as doing the same thing are those by Jenova Chen.

    Another short game that I could fit between breaks to take my mind off of things. I remember when My Friend Pedro was a flash game, and it is good to see it come back as a full fledged game.
    Outside of the standard 2d side scrolling bullet time action, there are additional mechanics that are introduced to keep everything fresh.

    This podcast helped me understand what Peter Norvig's priorities are and how he views education of computer science related topics.
    It also helped to highlight some of the shortcomings of the class I am taking right now which emphasizes technique without philosophy.
    There is a reason why his textbooks include a section on philosophy, and the fact that he made a point of that in this podcast shows that blindly using the techniques within his textbook without any considerations of implications they may bring is mistaken.

  explanation: >
    I was unable to watch this live due to the time differences.
    Musk starts off with his usual spiel about being a multiplanetary species, but once he finishes with that, he gets down to details and presents the technical details.
    The largest improvement in the Starship design is the usage of 301 stainless steel which is far cheaper than whatever carbon composite or aluminium composite that was being considered before.
    This presentation also covers the design of the heat shield to prevent cracking under extreme heat.
    Interestingly, Musk mentioned that refueling in orbit is more trivial than docking with the space station.
    Finally, another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzFQJUzoUvM" target="_blank">simulation</a> involving the Superheavy and Starship has been made with the updated designs.
    Some of the timelines presented here are ambitious even for Musk, but if it is him, we may see a fully functional Starship Superheavy combo in 2 years.
    On another note, I really liked what he said about schedules. If it's long, it's wrong. If it's tight, it's right.

  explanation: >
    A game that is short enough that I could finish it between breaks.
    Superhot is a game that manages to do a lot with a simple premise and in the process, it ends up being very thought provoking even though the the story is rather simple.
    The primary mechanic is that time will only flow when you move. This allows you to dodge bullets, cut bullets out of the air with a sword, and do things that wouldn't be possible with a traditional fps.
    Later in the game, you gain the ability to transfer your conciousness to enemy characters which adds another layer of freedom to the game.
    I found this to be very similar to the Matrix despite in being not as wordy or philosophical. Great way to let off steam.

    A graphical explanation of linear algebra that can be used to build a more visual intuition of the subject.
    I found the first few videos the most useful, but it is a solid series throughout.
    I recommend watching it from the beginning in order to have a good understanding of the fundamentals.

  explanation: >
    In the 50's and 60's, Westerns were a more romanticized genre that had a certain veneer about it. In the 60's and 70's, the western became more violent, but also more stylized.
    This film draws from those eras, but also adds a dose of realism and cynicism to its voice.
    In addition to being directed by Clint Eastwood, it was written by David Webb Peoples who was one of the writers of Blade Runner.
    Unforgiven is a film that is on the level of other great Westerns like The Searchers and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
    I found its third act to be particularly well done and thought the dialogue was better written than some of the classic Westerns directed by John Ford and Sergio Leone.

  explanation: >
    Although this is a tale of adolescence, it doesn't fall within the traditional trope of a coming of age story.
    In that sense, it is somewhat subversive, but the story is not the strongest point of this film.
    The strongest aspect of this film is the camera work.
    The way the objects inside of the frame tell the story and the way movement is used is quite different from other films during the time that played things by the book.
    I had flashbacks to Scorsese and Kubrick films that used similar shots, but came after this film was released.
    There is an obvious stylistic influence on directors who saw this film during their formative years and its role as a film that is representative of the French New Wave is well deserved.

    I just think this is cool. It shows how important an environment is for an agent to learn in addition to the actual way trials are carried out.

    Tom Cruise is getting older, but his stunts are getting more and more elaborate. Fallout is, in my opinion, a great example of Hollywood style action.
    Set pieces are great and the locations are well thought out. Camera work is deliberate and everything seems to have been well thought out.

  explanation: >
    Probably the last game I will have the time to complete for a while. Borderlands 2 is like Borderlands 1, but it is bigger and seems to have an emphasis on coop play.
    This can make it frustrating for anyone who is playing solo. Also, because of the lack of weapons types and abilities, it can come across as repetitive.
    In terms of the looter shooter genre, this seems to be one of the best, but I think it was definitely made for multiplayer.
    It has much of the same type of humor as the previous entry, but if you want to live in the world of Pandora without dealing with some of the more frustrating elements of the game, you might be better off playing Tales from the Borderlands instead.

      Space elevators, skyhooks, and orbital rings are the trinity of methods to allow payloads to reach space very cheaply.
      Although the space industry is currently obsessed with rockets, if you want truly sustainable space travel at a very cheap price, the orbital ring is the gold standard for getting into space.
      If such infrastructure exists, multistage rockets might become obsolete, and single stage rockets launched directly from orbit for interplanetary travel may become the next new thing.

      Thunderbolt Fantasy is the result of a collaboration between Japanese and Taiwanese companies.
      The story draws from old samurai and swordsman stories like the Seven Samurai and is set in a world similar to the kind seen in Chinese Xuanhuan novels.
      It truly is a mixture of cultural tropes, and the main selling point of glove puppetry only makes it all the more unique.

  explanation: >
      A browser game that emulates what it is like to live with depression.
      Any choices that allow one to recover from the disorder are scratched out, making the game very linear with very little choice.
      It could be that this was intended to simulate the downward spiral associated with depression, but it it also sacrificed depth as a result.
      I find this design choice to be questionable, because it is possible to recover from depression.
      If there is no choice, there is no point.
      As a result, this was a rather unenjoyable game that seems to have been made to educate and make a point rather than to entertain.
      I think it can be improved if there was more choice or at least an explanation of how choice is understood and considered within the context of this game.

      This movie introduces Shazam and also offers a preview of the Shazam kids.
      It is humorous and doesn't get into any heavy themes.
      In many ways, it feels like it is following the Marvel formula and shares similarities with Dr. Strange, but lacks many of the metaphysical aspects as well as the complicated special effects of the later work.
      It isn't anything special, but it is a fun time and if DC continues with this level of quality, they may be able to have something on par with the Marvel universe in the future.

  explanation: >
      It's like Journey, but not quite.
      The soundtrack by Austin Wintory is in spectacular form and the art direction is identical to what may be found in Thatgamecompany's games.
      However, the narrative structure and level design is different.
      Abzû's level design is more simplistic, but at the same time there is more on screen.
      Giant Squid Studios successfully replicates some of the mystery of our oceans and in the process sacrifices the feelings of isolation and spirituality that was present in Journey.
      This sacrifice seems intentional, because Abzû is going for something different.
      Abzû is not necessarily going for feelings of the spiritual kind, but rather the primeval.
      The Sumerian origins of the game's title seems to support this.
      As such, it may not bring out introspection like Journey, but a different kind of externally directed feeling towards the expansiveness of our reality that is very difficult to describe.
      In many ways, this feels like a companion piece to Journey that tries to do what Journey did not to create a complete whole.
      I feel like it succeeded, but I would have preferred a more clear emotional narrative like Flower or Journey.

      It is amazing how something as lifeless as rock can have so many dimensions and features.
      While the movie Free Solo focuses on Alex Honnold's free solo climb of El Capitan, it manages to also successfully express the depth involved in the world of rock climbing.

      A civil war epic that focuses on the first all black volunteer company.
      Edward Zwick made his best movies earlier in his career, and this is towards the top of his filmography.

  explanation: >
      I wanted to read something in Japanese, but reading an entire novel seemed like a chore, so I settled for this.
      I remember buying this in a Book Off when I was in Japan for the first time.
      Unlike the animated series, this seems slower paced.
      That's not to say that the original source is any less of an urban jungle, or any less kinetic, but there is a little more fat on the bone with this one.
      They don't make manga like this anymore, so the subject matter is still fresh.
      The idea of rollerblades on steroids to do high speed parkour is still interesting and the feelings of freedom that accompany the premise are still there.
      That said, there are a few small things that annoyed me when I was reading this.
      Often times, there is incorrect Japanese or simply incorrect furigana accompanying the kanji.
      This could be due to the characters speaking in a rough manner, but it made what should have been an easy read a little bit harder.

  explanation: >
      Among all of the film adaptations of Broadway musicals that I have seen, Les Misérables has the best cinematography.
      This is not too surprising because Tom Hooper directed The King's Speech before this.
      That said, the camera shakes a little too much for my liking.
      One of the things I found surprising was that the music was actually not up to par with other musicals.
      One of the reasons for this is singing ability.
      The cast can sing, but for some reason, they always sound out of breath.
      I'm not sure if this was a directorial decision, but I found that it took away from the impact.
      My general impression is that this is just below what is expected of a great film, and improvements in sound and pacing would have raised my opinion of the work.

  explanation: >
      This is said to be the best Far Cry game and also the game with the best story in the series.
      While it has less realism than Far Cry 2, this does not diminish the gameplay.
      One thing I noticed is that it seems to have many similarities to the Assassin's Creed games in terms of game mechanics.
      This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on whether you have the patience to explore the open world presented.
      Vaas is a well written villain and a memorable one.
      In regards to the open world, there are many places to explore, but the islands seem pretty much the same throughout, and the npc's lack depth.
      It is designed well for eating up time, but not so much for making meaningful memories in its world.
      I recommend first capturing radio towers, then finishing the hunting missions, and finally the steamrolling through game's story for the best experience and minimal fuss.

  explanation: >
      Chicago is one of the longest running Broadway musicals, so I was interested in seeing how a stage musical would be adapted to film.
      It's done rather well, but it's not for me.
      The songs used the jazz of the 1920's as a basis to create catchy tunes, and the acting was well executed as well.
      Due to its satirical nature, I personally found that there were no characters I could relate to or identify with.
      If you're into tap or jazz dance, this might be for you, but in film, I believe that story is most important and I did not like the story in this one.

  explanation: >
      I really liked this musical. Despite the name, you actually don't need to know anything about opera before seeing this.
      The operas referred to within this play are fictional and don't even exist.
      The music is also very accessible with electric guitar parts and lyrics intended to win over a larger audience.
      The story is a mixture of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Beauty and the Beast.
      Like those titles, this has the appeal of a disney film and it ends up being rather meta as well.
      There is a certain 4th wall breaking aspect to the play due to the fact that there are stage sequences inside of a staged work.
      Overall, it is a fun musical that I found to be better than Cats.

      I'm not the biggest fan of the Jojo series, but I keep watching it so that I can keep up with the memes.
      I personally liked the second part the best because it did not have stands, but now that we are on part five, I can say that this manages to take the concept of a 'Stand' to a new level.
      There are tons of Stand battles and, at this point, Araki Hirohiko has gotten rather skilled at using the limitations and strengths of Stands to draw out as much suspense as possible.
      It also helps that characters have exaggerated reactions and characteristics.
      Overall, I found this to be an entertaining entry.

  explanation: >
      Emulated and upscaled through PCSX2.
      Ico is one of the greatest games ever made for good reason.
      Ico is great in the classical sense.
      It tells a simple story of companionship and isolation and draws from many ancient cultures such as ancient Greece and Rome for architecture and storytelling, and ancient Japan and ancient China for geography, language, mythology, clothing and everything else.
      The puzzles use simple mechanics in multiple different ways to create variety.
      Due to its age, the combat mechanics are nothing special, but they don't take anything particularly away from the work as a whole.
      Despite it being overshadowed by Shadow of the Colossus (which I played as a child), it manages to sufficiently stand up on its own and lay the technical and stylistic groundwork for Fumito Ueda's later works.
      Similarly, many of Jenova Chen's works seem to have many stylistic elements taken from Ico.
      This is an important work that is often unfairly overlooked. I highly recommend it.

  explanation: >
      Is having the heroine die from sickness a common opera trope?
      Anyways, the story begins like a bad joke where a poet, a painter, a singer, and a musician all walk into a bar.
      Despite the characters having different professions, I found it funny that everyone including the singer could sing.
      La Boheme, unlike other opera entries did not have highly technical music, and in some ways, it came across as cliche.
      Despite this, the delivery of the story was a great reflection of the time in which it was made, and it managed to balance comedy, tragedy and drama rather well.
      I would consider this better than The Magic Flute, but not better than Carmen or La Traviata.

  explanation: >
      When I saw that there was a part 2, I thought they were selling out, but I could not have been more wrong.
      This entry elevates the series to become one of the greatest works of Japanese animation and puts it on the same level as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Steins;Gate in my opinion.
      The first half had action on a scale similar to Lord of the Rings with pacing and stakes that was similar to Mad Max Fury Road.
      The second half finally provides answers to questions that were asked in previous seasons and subtly introduces philosophical questions and concepts.
      There were allusions to World War II, gestures to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and a healthy dose of cynicism to keep everything from getting pretentious.
      This does everything right, the payoff is amazing, and we're still not at the end.
      Regardless of whether everything ends with a bang or a whimper, I am confident that the ending will be thoughtfully constructed and provided with the same high quality treatment we have seen in previous entries.

  explanation: >
      It is strange seeing Eric Weinstein with his boss, but somehow this conversation manages to work due to its subject matter.
      There are topics presented here that I don't usually see being talked about such as the technological stagnation we are currently experiencing.
      While it may be true that there are many gradualistic advances in technology, there are very few fundamental saltatory improvements in the technology we currently use.
      This is why technology appears to be stagnant. Simply put, there are no new discoveries being made. We are simply finding new ways to use the discoveries that were made in the past.
      The second topic that is covered at length is the counterproductive nature of higher education and academia within the United States and the damages caused by those running the larger institutions that fall within this category.
      All in all, I found that this was a thoughtful conversation that examined a problem many have not even acknowledged.

      Back in the day before computer manufacturers just assembled parts and just made things fit within a chasis, there were companies that built entire computers from scratch.
      This is one such story.
      This is not the story of a company starting small and then making it big.
      It is just the story of how a single computer (Eagle) in Data General was made from beginning to end.
      Many of the things here were all too familiar to me since I was an engineer, but since it was in a different industry, during a different time, I found it interesting to see what people were concerned about back then.

  explanation: >
      I'm sick and tired of Mozart.
      I hear his stuff everywhere and I have trouble enjoying it anymore.
      It sounds like a bunch of arpeggios and scales to me with nothing to distinguish it from other classical music-- almost as if a mindless computer wrote it.
      The story of the Magic Flute is simple, but it makes up for its simplicity for its imagery and symbolism.
      Vocals are also very technical.
      German is rather similar to Dutch, so I found myself understanding some of the content without needing subtitles.

  explanation: >
      The Breakfast Club is unorthodox in its organization, but it manages to work because it places all of its actors in one room and asks the simple question of what happens.
      There are no weak links because of its small cast.
      While it does not necessarily say the most profound things in its main message, this coming of age story is fun to watch from beginning to end and does not drag at all.

  explanation: >
      This book, in my opinion, was almost perfect for its first half.
      Because it is a young adult novel, the prose is simpler than other works, but it still read beautifully.
      Books don't need to be a convoluted mess of high diction to be good and this novel is a testament to that fact.
      In terms of characters, all of the characters are given an appropriate amount of attention and the emotional weight of their struggles are carried to the reader rather effectively.
      In regards to the hard sci-fi themes that show up later in the book, they are explored rather well in the first half, but never truly explored in depth in the later half.
      I don't think Patrick Ness is a sci-fi writer, so this may be easily forgiven if he focused more on the struggles of the individual characters rather than fill pages with strange detours in the later half.
      This book had so much potential, and that is why I like it, but it is not a perfect book.
      If you read just the first half and stop there, you may actually enjoy it better.
      That said, the ending was rather thoughtful, so I'll leave it up to your judgement.

  explanation: >
      My second opera. This time, instead of a film, I watched the full production with subtitles.
      I was originally watching the Royal Opera's version, but for some reason, they dropped the subtitles, so I finished with the Taomina Festival version.
      Unlike the Royal Opera (which has Carmenita in a gorilla suit for some reason), the Taormina Festival version was far more faithful to the source material.
      This made it far more accessible to me. In terms of story, I felt that Carmen was better than La Traviata, but did not have the same level of vocal technicality as La Traviata.
      The characters were more understandable this time around, and I found it interesting that I didn't like Carmenita, but actually rooted for Micaëla.
      The music, in my opinion was the best part. This was, in many ways, a compilation of best hits of Georges Bizet and that worked to its strengths.
      Unlike older operas, the music here had something of a unique oriental flavor that set it apart from other operas that were far more rigid due to their classical occidental influences.

      We see some old faces in this one like Soap and Price.
      While this is a continuation of the first modern warfare, there are some differences in style.
      The first difference is that while the first modern warfare was more realistic, this was a little more over the top like a Hollywood blockbuster.
      This made for some very interesting levels with high stakes, but in the process, it lost a little bit of what made the first modern warfare great.
      The soundtrack by Lorne Balfe and Hans Zimmer was well done and better executed in this entry.
      Overall, it is a great game that went by very quickly, but it does not seem to reach the heights that were reached by its predecessor.

      This is a book that is highly dependent on suspension of disbelief.
      It may be because of the age of the work, but the timescale that the Old Ones operate within is simply unrealistic.

      I saw the first film in the trilogy and heard that the rest of the Hobbit Trilogy was a bloated mess, so I decided to watch the Maple Films edit instead.
      This version is rather faithful to the source material and cuts out much of the fat to create a tighter story.
      Unlike what I've seen of the trilogy previously, this came across as coherent.
      While Lord of the Rings was a story of Men and Hobbits, this was a coherent story of Dwarves and a single Hobbit.
      That said, I do think it is a bit long for one book and it does not match the scale of Lord of the Rings.

      Lines were delivered quickly, but also with careful timing and jokes did not lower themselves to the common denominator.
      There is some cleverness to this juvenile work and I enjoyed it.

  explanation: >
      Read the extended version.
      Stephen King is an author who is capable of flailing around in the darkness and grabbing a decent story without planning it.
      By planting seeds and symbols throughout the post apocalyptic novel, he was able to add many different layers.
      There is the Dark Man who shows up in many of Stephen King's novels.
      There is the biblical and supernatural aspects that mirror the rapture.
      And finally, there is the intricacies of human nature in all its beauty and ugliness.
      This is Stephen King's War and Peace.
      It isn't consistent in terms of quality throughout, but it is a great book with depth that manages to be entertaining.

      Due to a power outage, I decided to take the time to go through some old books on my shelf.

      The rocket presented is nuclear powered unlike the Saturn V.

      What is presented here looks like what vacuum tube computers looked like back in the 50's and 60's.
      It's not where we should be, but it is a start.
      What is presented here is an order of magnitude improvement on the state of the art in brain computer interfaces.
      It can be used to restore certain faculties of the mind for those who have some form of nerve or brain damage.
      The use of needles, threads, and robots to optimize the process allows for a less invasive and far more scaleable solution compared to standard brain surgery.
      I really want to see what they come up with, but at the moment, the technology is still in its infancy and because the N1 is the first product, it is too soon to determine if the trends in the industry are promising.

      A short book with little to offer that I haven't read about already in other books.
      Also, the idea that nothing is worth doing if you are not the best at doing it is highly flawed and will lead to an unfulfilled life.
      The concept of what is "Best" needs to be elaborated on further than it already is.

      One of the better Spiderman films out there.
      It's higher in scale than the previous MCU Spiderman Film, but it isn't quite as epic as an Avengers film.

      I'm going to be visiting Europe next month, so I also appreciated the set pieces and locations.

      Inner Engineering is split into two parts.
      The first focuses on Sadhguru's experiences and the shortcomings of modern society to foster joy.
      The second focuses on yogic principles framed in a modern context.
      It also provides activities that can be followed to train the mind.
      Much of the book is organized in such a way that you can focus your efforts on what you struggle with.

      Michael Cimino made one good movie and this is it.
      There are many Vietnam films, but this is one that stands closer to the top.
      I wouldn't consider it to be as good as Apocalypse Now, but I think it is rather close.
      The Russian roulette scenes were the best parts of the film.
      Not only were they brutal, but they could draw out an incredible amount of suspense in short bursts.
      It also helped that the acting of Robert Deniro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep elevated the film higher.

      The final installment tries to tread the same ground as the 1995 film, but does not make any deep emotional or philosophical conclusions.
      This time, it presents the possibilities of fused conciousnesses, single conciousnesses that can diverge, and multiple people sharing one body.
      In the future, the concept of a body will fundamentally change and become separated from one's identity.
      As our humanity becomes more abstract, it will be interesting to see how we maintain or try to maintain the things we believe makes us human.

      My first opera.
      Anna Mofo was terrific as Violetta.
      The story was not anything complex, but the vocal gymnastics involved was just insane.
      Also, it was interesting to see the context of Verdi's music.
      I have typically just listened to the music of Verdi, but now I understand what scenes they were used for.
      Opera is truly an interesting genre.
      Every bit of dialogue is sung, but unlike broadway plays, the vocal talent required is higher and there is less choreography.
      It is not very accessible due to the language, however. I recommend watching operas with dual subtitles to get the best experience.

      My second Walter Isaacson book. The general impression I have is that people have an opinion of Steve Jobs that ignores his flaws.
      Bill Burr makes this point in one of his interviews.
      This book does not simply praise, and Walter Isaacson shows both the good and the bad.
      Steve Jobs had successes and failures, and Walter Isaacson covers all of it.
      Unlike the film, this also covers his childhood and his identity as an adopted child.

      A short but memorable game that evokes feelings of spirituality through its surreal nature and game mechanics.
      Gorogoa's strengths lie in its visual style.
      It is through this visual style that the player feels like they are brought into the pages of a picture book or a 2d dream.
      The soft music with experimental electronics only serve to further that surreal nature of the game.
      There is a story being told throughout the levels, but because nothing is concretely explained, it is up to the player to offer their own interpretation.

      Interestingly, tomorrow is the 60th anniversary of this film.
      North by Northwest is a fun, delightful film by Hitchcock. Possibly my favorite of his works.
      In my opinion Eva Marie Saint stole the spotlight.
      This is probably the closest Hitchcock would ever get to directing a James Bond film.
      It's suspensful, intriguing, and the premise is original.
      Set pieces are well made, and none of the scenes bore.
      For a film from the late 1950's, this manages to entertain even today.

      R is a great language for displaying data.

      I'm trying to get into Broadway plays and this is the first play to introduce me to the genre.
      In terms of accessibility, I think this is a good play to start with.
      I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I saw it as a child.
      The story is simple and much of the emphasis is placed on choreography and music.
      The level of athleticism required for the roles in this play is high, and as someone with a dance background, it made for a decent work to study.
      Memories is a good song, and it has qualities similar to many of the songs in West Side Story that allow for its impact last well beyond the viewing of the play.

  explanation: >
      Night in the Woods is a game with anthropomorphic characters that takes place in a small, struggling town with a dwindling population.
      This is a game that focuses not on gameplay, but on story.
      The story itself is above average.
      While I would not call it a coming of age tale, it shares many qualities of that style of story with Life is Strange.
      Similarly, Mae, the main character, walks slowly, talks slowly, and it takes a long time to do simple things which artificially lengthens the play time.
      Where the story truly shines is in its third act where mysteries are solved and arcs are concluded.
      Its focus on story helps, and I hope others follow its example while taking care to actually focus on the quality of the story similar to how screenwriters craft the flow and pacing of a film.

      Action sequences are well thought out and coordinated in a way that is only comparable to The Matrix.

      Images are vibrant and movement is fluid.
      As a guitar player, this definitely played to my tastes and some of the songs were catchy.
      Story-wise, it does not do anything groundbreaking and I was able to figure out what would happen in the third act because it dropped too many hints.
      Portrayals of Mexico tend to be rather negative in Hollywood, so this film with its bright colors, positive outlook on death and emphasis on family is a welcome change.

  explanation: >
      The original 1995 film was a huge influence on me and I am glad to enter that world once more.
      Ghost Pain is the first entry in a series of four films that act as something of an origin story for Section 9 and a refresh of the IP.
      With a different director behind the camera, one should expect different results.
      There are fewer existential questions being asked, the scale is smaller, the music is more subtle and drawn back.
      In terms of emotional punch, it is definitely inferior to the original TV series as well as the original films, but it still somehow manages to be thought provoking.
      They don't censor the violence, and the content is not dumbed down for a modern audience.
      Stylistically, it is faithful to the source material.

  explanation: >
      A gem of a film that is about parenthood and childhood with a twist.
      It should come to no surprise given the number of awards it has won.
      Mamoru Hosada is a skilled director whose films I have seen before.
      The last film of his that I have seen is Summer Wars, and that was more than 6 years ago.
      While the scale of this story is not quite at the level of Summer Wars, the smaller scale allows it to be a more touching story that is able to connect with its viewers due to its personal touch.
      Single parenthood in Japan is not often covered in film, so this film in particular was covering new ground while telling an original tale of its own during the time it was released.

      It was not for me, but it is an above average romance film.
      Scenes of opulence might impress initially, but I feel like it won't be all that impressive after time passes and will degrade with multiple viewings.
      This film does not do anything new in the genre, but it does provide a window into East Asian culture.
      Many of the Confucianist principles such as filial piety are emphasized.

      Great book, but it drags a little compared to the others in terms of pacing towards the end. Despite this, I still liked it for its dark treatment of the subject matter.
      Unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it was dark in tone like The Two Towers, and it provided a long but rewarding conclusion to a great trilogy.
      Just a wonderful adventure, deep lore, and a world that the reader would like to visit again and again. It's kind of a shame that the main offerings of Middle Earth are this trilogy and The Hobbit.
      I wish J.R.R. Tolkien had other epic stories similar to The Lord of the Rings, but there is always the Silmarillion and The Children of Hurin to keep me satisfied.

      One of the best on the SNES. It is as great as FFVI if not better.
      The music was iconic, the character development was well thought out and each character had weight and importance to the player.
      The idea of a time traveling antagonist is genius. We've seen this trope more in Japanese culture, but in American films, this trope is very rare, making it feel novel.
      Lavos is one of the best villains ever. It does not say a word, but it had presence.
      In terms of depth, it is not as deep as FFVI, but I think that was perfectly fine because there was no grinding involved.
      The game mechanics accomplished their goal and a great story was told.
      The addition of the FMV's and multiple endings was much appreciated.
      Definitely a game everyone should play once in their lives.

      The second entry in the Lord of the Rings. A really great read that expands on characters in a way the movies just couldn't.
      The lore is presented in greater detail, and it is just a fine adventure that doesn't get majorly sidetracked.
      Only complaint I have is that sometimes it focuses too much on description instead of the actions of the characters, but this adds to the world building, so it can be easily forgiven.
      From Helms Deep to the Ents to the taming of Smeagol, this book is just consistently high quality. For me, it was better than The Fellowship of the Ring.

  explanation: >
      I am gradually getting convinced that the Disney Renaissance was the best period for 2d animation at Disney.
      Aladdin is unique in that it has a male protagonist.
      It is set within the context of Arabian Nights, and the writers did not shy away from mentioning beheadings and the punishment of cutting off hands for stealing.
      I found that rather interesting given that this is intended for children.
      It is also a film that had celebrity voice actors that knocked it out of the park such as Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried.
      The character design is slightly different from The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, and the animators went for a more flexible slapstick style when it came to movement.
      CGI was also utilized during a time when the technology was still in its infancy.
      This is definitely not a traditional Disney princess film, and it brings a lot of new things to the table.

  explanation: >
      The level of depth in this work is incredible given how accessible the story is.
      It does not use overly sophisticated language, but it still manages to fit in an entire universe worth of lore without coming across as overwhelming.
      Unlike the films, there is a greater emphasis on the hobbits instead of Aragorn which seems appropriate to me because they make more suitable heroes if one is going off of Joseph Campbell's work in The Hero with a Thousand Faces.
      One thing that I noticed here that I did not notice when watching the film was how there seemed to be a strange emphasis on race that borders on racism.
      I don't think this is intentional, but it is noticeable.
      Reading this gave me greater respect for the film.
      There are parts of this that I would have thought were unadaptable, but somehow Peter Jackson managed to make it work.

  explanation: >
      My first Neal Stephenson book. This comes across almost as a steampunk story where the steam is replaced with nanotechnology.
      The oppressed groups are there, and the young child getting abused is also there (although she isn't an orphan).
      Emotionally, this book is kind of stunted, but the world building and detail is on another level.
      The adventures Nell goes on through the Primer are entertaining and offer a hint of what one may consider a decent education to be.
      One complaint I have is that although Neal Stephenson has pages upon pages of great descriptive imagery, his technical descriptions are lacking in rigor.
      Another complaint I have is pacing. The last parts of the novel came quickly and brought no closure.
      I guess maybe the reader is supposed to figure all that out on their own, because the end comes suddenly and mercilessly without allowing the reader a chance to take it in.

      An undeniably great film from Martin Scorsese. It was filmed in black and white and harkens back to older films from the 40's and 50's with its style.
      There are shots in here that are so original, I honestly don't think I've seen anything similar over my 10+ years of serious/critical film watching.
      The cast is great and Robert Deniro's weight gain to play Jake La Motta in his later years made him almost unrecognizable.

  explanation: >
      This is a strange book. The meaning of Catch 22 is always changing. Events are told out of order.
      The subject matter is serious, but it is told in a comedic and satiric way.
      Yossarian is probably what any soldier feels like.
      Based on what I've been told, the military is a highly inefficient monster and the experiences of personel is dependent upon the groups you are assigned to.
      Catch 22 seems to emphasize this, and exaggerates it to create a caricature of the U.S. military that is both hilarious and accurate.
      Like in Catch 22, officers are not only underqualified for their jobs, but they obsess over strange things and try to get out of their responsibilities.
      It was an interesting read and I have a positive impression of it, but it is definitely an unorthodox novel.

      For 1937, this level of quality was at least 10 years ahead of its time.
      Snow White has decent screen time, the songs are memorable even though they can get rather technical, and the Dwarves are well thought out.

      Similar to the Hangover, but focuses on highschool and relationships made towards the end of highschool.
      Typical American comedy fare with a raunchy sense of humor.

      This was airing the first time I was in Japan and I never really had the time to watch it until now.
      Shounen sports anime is a highly saturated genre, so it is very rare when a show about men's volleyball raises the bar.
      For this first entry in the series, they focus on the team more than the individual.
      There are those with exceptional talents, but it takes more than one to keep the volleyball from hitting the ground.
      Although there are main characters, everyone is treated with great importance.
      The sport is introduced to viewers who are unfamiliar with the game in a very effective way with all the positions and moves fully explained.
      Sets itself up for the future entries in the series very well.

  explanation: >
      Read the John Dryden translation which emphasized meter and rhyme compared to what may be found in more modern translations.
      The Aeneid almost reads like a fan fiction that somehow ended up improving on the material that served as inspiration.
      Because it is more modern than The Iliad, it has more sophisticated narrative structure.
      One thing that I found to work against The Aeneid was its length.
      Because it was short, many of the characters who were introduced were less memorable than the characters introduced in The Iliad.
      Overall, I found it to be better than the Iliad just because of its sophistication and because it knew how to end.

  explanation: >
      Written by Liu Ciuxin and translated by Ken Liu. There are some very well thought out and great concepts presented here.
      Aspects of communication between species separated by light years is covered in detail.
      The concept of a sophon or artificially intelligent proton was mind blowing.
      As a civilization begins to improve in sophistication, its ability to control things at the microlevel and eventually transcend dimensions is an inevitability.
      The way covers the techological advances of the Trisolaris civilization is creative and just on another level.
      The progress of civilization being split between stable and chaotic eras is also a great touch.
      The author truly understood how intelligent progress and science works and managed to also tie it in with the cultural roadblocks presented by Chinese society.

      This is such a weird imaginative film.
      I did not recognize Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice.
      That's how great his acting was.
      The practical effects, makeup and puppetry really sold the afterlife and gave it an identity of its own.
      This is a great example of Tim Burton's style and his unique directorial idiosyncrasies.

      Introduced the Blue Moon lander and the New Glenn.
      It was interesting to see Jeff Bezos present his ideas and how they differed from Musk's.
      While it is discouraging to see that they currently just seem to be retracing Space X's steps at a slower rate, the purpose of Blue Origin is fundamentally different, so this may be fine.
      Jeff Bezos is more of a big picture guy and he is focused more on space infrastructure than anything else.
      Musk on the other hand wants to go to Mars and seems to have a better understanding of the details involved to improve execution.

  explanation: >
      One of the higher rated Disney princess films, but I didn't understand the point of it.
      The fairy godmother showed up out of nowhere.
      The mice and other animals got more screen time than Cinderella.
      Like usual, the animation is well done, and human characters are fluidly animated due to rotoscoping.
      Cinderella is not a character with much depth and is only a vehicle for wish fulfillment unlike Beauty and the Beast.
      The prince is one dimensional here unlike what could be seen in Sleeping Beauty and newer films.
      There are some iconic songs here, but it boggles the mind that the film gets as much praise as it does.

  explanation: >
      About three weeks of intense reading was what it took to make it from one end of this book to the others.
      This is a book that is consistent throughout if you ignore Leo Tolstoy's philosophical musings.
      That said, his philosophical musings and justifications explain the purpose of this novel as well as the greater reasons as to why this novel was written.
      This novel covers everything. The rich, the poor, how war affects all, love, family, life and death.
      I remember thinking about reading this in highschool, but decided not to then because of the character count.
      For those who are intimidated by the more than 500 characters presented in this novel, you'll only need to focus on the main ones.
      Pierre, the Rostov's, the Bolkonsky's and the higher rank figures in the war are really what you'll need to remember.
      I recommend reading this great novel. You might be turned off because of its length, but as you start to dig in, you'll find that it is manageable due to the short chapter lenghts.
      This is a journey you will wish to never end, and luckily, it's so long that it feels like it doesn't.

  explanation: >
      A fitting conclusion to a decades worth of world building and story telling.
      Unlike other superhero films, it was not quite as predictable, and it seemed to check all the boxes for what I wanted for the penultimate film of phase 3.
      It had good moments, and it also made callbacks to films that were made earlier in the Marvel universe.
      In terms of scale, it wasn't quite as large as Infinity War, but I think that helped to keep the plot tight and prevent things from getting convoluted.
      I have no complaints. It's not a perfect film, but I think most people will leave theatres satisfied.

      A near perfect Disney animated film. The animation is fluid, and the music is iconic and has survived over the years.
      The characters faces look lopsided, but I think that is more of a stylistic choice.
      It copies details from Sleeping Beauty and other predecessors.
      Overall, its qualities lie in the lack of mistakes, but it doesn't seem to do anything particularly groundbreaking.
      Its quality is consistent with the other great Disney films of its time.

      The last time I saw a Makoto Shinkai film was about 5-6 years ago when I saw the beautiful Kotonoha no Niwa.
      In many ways, this feels almost like a thesis statement that Shinkai built up over his 10+ years of experience.
      The fluid animation and vibrant colors from his previous works can be seen here.
      The common themes of the distance between people and what separates them and brings them together is thoroughly explored through the main premise of trading places in dreams.
      In addition to this, he infuses Japanese culture and presents Japan in a very realistic way.
      It really is deserving of all the praise that it has received.

  explanation: >
      There is nothing else like it. The music was conducted by the legendary Leopold Stokowski, and the animation was on point.
      For 1940, this level of fluidity and abstractness in an animation is absolutely mind blowing.
      It's an experience that is unique and difficult to reproduce. It is one thing to film something and set it to music.
      It is another to animate something to music.
      In this work, the marriage of sound and image are treated in a highly expert fashion.

      There aren't many shows about running, but this is one of them and it is great.
      This was originally a book before it was adapted to a movie and finally into a show.
      I loved how it covered the personal journeys everyone experiences in running as well as the competitive scene involved in running long distance as a team.
      The soundtrack by Hayashi Yuki was great as well.

  explanation: >
      Watching this before I watch Endgame. Captain Marvel is a movie that tries to do many things. It hits some notes, but it does not hit all of them.
      There are enjoyable moments and moments where where it drags. There are great shots and scenes where the camerawork was not thought out all that well.
      The special effects are impressive as always. The way Samuel L. Jackson was made to look younger was something that I found to be techincally notable.
      I was skeptical of Brie Larson's casting, but she does well in her role as Carol Danvers. Overall, I liked it, but I thought it could have been better.
      My guess is that important scenes had to be edited out for the theatrical cut, because it felt like something was missing.

      Unlike Disney's offerings in the 40's, this felt a lot more polished.
      The animation is beautiful, and I can even see great implementations of rotoscoping in character movement.
      Any shortcomings in animation were successfully compensated by great background work.
      Despite Sleeping Beauty being part of an oversaturated genre, I found it enjoyable, but the characters could have been given more depth.

      Better is a book about the struggles and triumphs of the medical system. He not only covers how medicine and treatment works in the U.S., but also in other countries like India.
      This provides a window into the challenges that are faced by practitioners.
      People sometimes forget that doctors need to worry about malpractice lawsuits and that diagnosis of an illness isn't quite as straight forward as it might seem in media.
      I found the end notes on how to be a positive deviant particularly useful.

      I actually liked it.
      It covered the sensitive topic of growing up very well and managed to do that through Bambi's experiences through the four seasons.
      Unlike Dumbo, this felt quite a bit more polished. You can really tell that it is a product of its time.
      The songs weren't made with commercial success in mind, and the characters weren't created with merchandise on the brain.
      If you were to compare it with The Lion King, you can find some of Bambi's DNA in the Lion King and other succeeding works.

  explanation: >
      It is so cool to watch an interesting concept be implemented so well.
      The actors age as time passes, and it does not feel like the cast is actually acting.
      The time where the characters grew up was the same time I grew up, so I found it very easy to relate.
      Instead of using digital cameras, film was used, and this allowed for the quality of the picture to stay consistent.
      I believe that this should be required viewing for any student of film due to its innovation and execution.

      I'm not sure what to say other than that the series is consistently good and that you can't seem to go wrong with it.
      The second arc of this season was great, but it weakened in the final arcs.
      If you view the series as one continuous story instead of splitting it between seasons, you may find it more enjoyable.
      All Might gets pushed to the limit and the stakes are raised higher and higher as all the characters gain greater skill in their journey to become superheroes.

      This book covers quite a bit of ground. It covers the Tarahumara who are exceptionally skilled at long distance running. It covers how central running is to being human.
      It introduces us to the world of ultra marathons, and it also discusses the disadvantages of shoes due to how they restrict our feet and increase the chances of injuries.
      While the writing can come across a little strong due to how it tries to tell a story instead of just present the facts, this also helps to make the read a little more enjoyable.
      What I took away from this is the following: run many miles to become good at running, be consistent, use shoes that does not restrict the toes and provides as flat a surface as possible.

      I'm not a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's Hollywood films, but this has all the makings of a classic.

      Camera work and scenes are shot very well. All in all, it is a solid film that displays much of what makes the Dutch people who they are today and offers a good explanation of the resistance movements in the Netherlands during Nazi occupation.

  explanation: >
    Oh boy, I have a lot to say about this one. First, where is my Trojan Horse? I read the Alexander Pope translation which made the read a struggle in the beginning.
    Luckily, I have read The Rape of the Lock before, so I gradually got over the difficult English and began to appreciate the masterful usage of the English language to maintain the poetic qualities of the epic.
    Roman and Greek names are used interchangeably which caused much confusion as well.
    The actual story is bloody, and sometimes nonsensical.
    The gods don't always behave rationally, and sometimes they can be bested in battle by mortals.
    The fact that Achilles pretty much singlehandedly turned the tide of battle towards the later part of the story made for a very strangely paced work.
    There are many characters and not all of them are introduced. You really need to read the rest of the Epic Cycle to truly gain a proper understanding of what is going on.
    Overall, it is great for a poem spread through oral tradition, but as an actual story, I found it lacking by modern standards. If you want something better, I recommend Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Mahabharata.

      My journey into the world of Disney 2d Animated films begins with Dumbo.
      For 1941, the work is impressive, but an experienced viewer will notice that the animators were focused mainly on the animation and music.
      The sound design and the story were not given as much attention. Not all movements by the animated characters have a sound, and because the story was simple enough, there was not as much effort placed there.
      I couldn't figure out if the crows at the end were a racist caricature or not. It seems like others have mixed opinions about them as well.

      A highly underrated film.
      This was created during a time when backgrounds and animations were carefully drawn by hand and technology did not allow as many shortcuts as they do now.
      While they could have gone for spectacle like many other Japanese animated films during the time, this work carefully navigates many topics such as the cold war, class warfare, and religion and frames those topics within the context of space travel.
      The storytelling is its strong point, but the animation and the score are able to stand up as prime examples of their medium.

  explanation: >
      The first entry in the Foundation trilogy covers the creation of the Foundation and the first century of its development.
      While I understand that this is an influential work of science fiction, I can't help but feel as if many of the concepts presented are quite dated or unrealistic.
      I find it strange that thousands of years in the future, we will have space faring monarchies, and that nuclear power will by the prime method of generating energy.
      In addition to this, I find it unrealistic that we would still be humanoids and struggle with many of the things we struggle with now.
      If one were to ignore all this, it does have the workings of a great political drama that takes place in space.

      Tom Hanks nails it. Adults want to go back to their childhood and children want to grow up.

      Before directing the Andrew Garfield Spiderman films, Marc Webb directed 500 Days of Summer.
      The composition of each scene is great, but the writing is not the best.

      The acting is not lacking and its somewhat more realistic treatment of romance in modern times makes it a worthwhile watch.

  explanation: >
      I was avoiding the last episode for a decent amount of time and it did not disappoint with the brutal amount of emotional weight it dumped on me.
      Made in Abyss might appear accessible to children on first glance, but this is a series that is mercilessly realistic in regards to the unforgiving nature of the world.
      To summarize Made in Abyss in a single sentence: two children journey to the depths of hell. The story is shown as an adventure into the abyss in search of the truth.
      With solid world building, this series beautifully displays the hero's journey in its entirety-- good parts and bad.
      Watching this reminded me of many greater works I have read in the past as well as historical tragedies: Dante's Inferno, Nietzsche, human experimentation during the Holocaust, and Grimm's Fairy Tales.
      The deep themes combined with Kevin Penkin's sophisticated score made this a very impactful story for me.
      I am wary and excited for the continuation and conclusion of this adventure.

  explanation: >
      Juno was surprising in that it had an overqualified cast and a script that is great during most of the film (although sometimes it does feel like it is trying too hard at times).
      The delivery of dialogue is quick and deadly. Camera work is above mediocre.
      I'm not sure if the film was trying to be hip or come across as quirky, but this sometimes backfires when it takes away from the emotional punch that can be delivered by the situation of unexpected teen pregnancy.
      Despite all this, I don't think that there is any other film like it and because of the short runtime, there isn't much to lose if the film doesn't connect.

      On its own merits, I don't see what the big deal is. Half Life 2 was a better game.
      What this game did have going for it was good level design.
      Story-wise, it was better than other games during the time, but it's nothing to write home about.
      While the player is given multiple weapons, they don't really add any new mechanics to the gameplay.
      Overall, the game is good, but I feel like it is overrated. The final boss was a pain to beat.

  explanation: >
      A classy noir film that is very similar to L.A. Confidential, L.A. Noir and The Maltese Falcon.
      Unlike those films, this is arguably darker and more unforgiving.
      I don't understand why, but 1970's films seem to have been more willing to take darker and more depressing turns compared to previous decades.
      This increase in realism allows for an easier suspension of disbelief and a smoother film to follow from the perspective of the viewer.

      I don't think I have ever seen a movie like this.
      This movie follows the story of Frank Abagnale and his adventures posing as different people while forging millions of dollars worth of checks.

      Back when this came out and helped to increase the popularity of multiplayer first-person shooters, I was unsure of what the big deal was.
      Now that I have completed it, I found that the realism and the ability to mimic the chaos of war made it an addicting and immersive experience.
      I can understand why it is praised by Iraq war veterans.
      Even though this game is more than 10 years old, it still feels ambitious and manages to hit most of the right notes.
      Even modern games developed today struggle to do the same.

      This was an interesting read due to many companies adopting the practices that Google has-- my company included.
      In many companies, the creative element needed to introduce interesting new products tends to be stifled, and in most they are not fostered.
      While it is unclear whether Google's approach is the best, what is clear is that the company takes risks and is more fluid than most companies of its size.
      Due to this, it manages to act as an example that helps to disprove many commonly held beliefs about how a company needs to be run to achieve success.

      It covers the many stories we tell and the similarities between all of them. The text is ripe with examples compiled from many different cultures.
      Because the story of the hero is in many ways the story of man, I found that by reading this, I not only learned about myths and religions, but of what the goals of man as an individual are.

      Halo 2 expands upon Halo: Combat Evolved by continuing the story, adding weapons, new enemies, dual wielding, and other combat mechanics.
      The game is solid, the story explores the inner politics of the covenant, and ends with a cliffhanger.

  explanation: >
      I am starting to view movies not just based on critical acclaim, but also keeping cultural impact in mind.
      Mean girls is a movie that has had great impact on modern American culture.
      Going into this, I was expecting it to be more family friendly, but the contents are suprisingly mature given the high school setting.
      In many ways, this movie is very similar to Easy A, but it focuses more on highschool cliques than on just popularity.
      I think Easy A is the better movie, but both are close in quality.
      The only major problem with Mean Girls I can think of is that it feels somewhat dated with cliques and types that have gone extinct in the 2000's.

      The first step in achieving anything is the intention of achieving that thing.
      Think and Grow Rich emphasizes the importance of mindset and how it leads everything and can ultimately lead to success.
      Although Napoleon Hill has not accomplished much himself, this book and the modern edits has some useful information.
      It also showed me how similar many self-help books are.
      I intend to take a long hiatus from books in this genre just because of diminishing returns.

  explanation: >
      I feel conflicted about this book.
      While I do agree that the American education system does not teach the right things, I feel like this book does not either.
      Advice can be vague and sometimes even counterproductive. An example of this is Robert Kiyosaki's praising of multi-level marketing.
      In many ways, it reads very similarly to The Art of the Deal, and does not provide enough concrete action items to work from.
      I agree that financial education should be more important. I agree that you shouldn't work for your money and that your money should work for you.
      However, the contents of this book felt more like a sales pitch for a class than something that people can use.

      I think the last time I found myself with a deep sense of saudade with a video game was after finishing the Mass Effect series about three years ago.
      That was exactly how I felt when I saw the credits roll the end of FFVI.
      From beginning to end, the game had something to offer in the form of a great story, and memorable characters.
      Because of this, I was sad to see it end. The game had great pacing, kept the grinding to a minimum, and was filled with worlds of exploration.
      It was ambitious, not only in its story, but in its refusal to center itself on a main character.
      Each character was given care and attention which made the payoff at the end all the more worth the hours poured in by the player.
      The creators knew exactly what they were doing when they named you the player as one of the characters in this SNES epic.

      This took about 4-5 months to complete and after finishing it, there are areas that I find to be shaky.
      This isn't all that surprising considering that the math involved is difficult to conceptually understand.

      By completing this, I improved my understanding of matrices, vectors, and alternate coordinate bases.

      Another thing to note is that it is not always advantageous to expend energy to appear favorable to everyone.

      Violet Evergarden is a series focused on the intentions infused into letters.
      The creators handle this subject matter with an appropriate amount of sensitivity through the fluidity and detail in the animation.
      Episodes cover the topic in a simple manner by focusing on the writer, the recipients, the process of writing, delivery, and how the letters are affected by the times in which they are written.
      In addition to this, the usage of letters as a motif that is used as an engine for character development is nothing short of masterful.
      In this day and age where physical letters are becoming more rare, this show manages to remind us of how humans can connect with one another.

  explanation: >
      This book introduces readers to the world of competitive memorization and some of the techniques one can use to remember things better.
      It covers in decent depth what memory is and what role it plays in our lives as well as the history of mnemonic technique.
      In addition to this, it also covers Joshua Foer's journey into the world of competitive memorization.
      While the book may read like a long article in a newspaper or magazine, it has useful information.
      Unfortunately, it is not an instructional guide to memorization and should not be treated as such.
      If you want to improve your mnemonic techniques, I recommend reading this book to introduce yourself to the world of memorization and then researching and practicing techniques on your own.
      Create a memory palace, and get into the habit of chunking. This book is like the packaging for a product, but not the product itself.

  explanation: >
      Aliens feels like what you would get if you crossed the original Alien with Die Hard and then scaled everything up.
      Although Aliens is more of an action film than sci-fi horror, James Cameron manages to keep much of what made the previous film great by only turning up the action in the second half of the film.
      For the first half, we don't see a single alien, and this allows for the maintaining of suspense as well as foreshadowing.
      While I prefer the original Alien because I prefer Ridley Scott's sensibilities, Aliens not only manages to match Alien in certain areas, but also manages to improve over Alien through its own unique qualities.

      There are not many films that take place in Antarctica, and there are even fewer that can take advantage of the setting in the way The Thing did.
      The Thing touches on themes of isolation, distrust, and combines them with a simple but solid premise.
      The special effects were impressive, and it is easy to see why this film influenced many horror directors as well as many Japanese directors such as Hideo Kojima and Takashi Miike.

      After reading The Lean Startup, I found myself questioning how in the world Theranos could survive for as long as it did.
      I suppose that proves how important the pitch and connections are. That said, it seemed like they did everything wrong except for PR and marketing.
      The executives did not listen to the engineers that worked on the testing machines, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani lied to investors and customers, the culture was toxic, and the concept of an mvp was completely foreign.

      That said, his views on using the proper metrics, innovation, and the emphasis on the minimum viable product are lessons that are very useful in both new companies and established companies.

  explanation: >
      The series continues with quality that is consistent with previous seasons and arguably hits notes that have not been hit before in previous seasons.
      The focus this time around is not on what lies outside of the walls, but rather what lies within.
      The third season plays more like a political thriller and as a result is able to provide exposition about the kingdom with nuance instead of through more heavy handed methods.
      A pattern a keen viewer might notice is that the director is gradually cycling through the six types of conflict in literature. In previous seasons, man vs. nature and man vs. man was covered thoroughly.
      This season focuses on man vs. society and man vs. self. If the previews of season 3 part 2 are anything to go by, we will soon seen man vs. technology and perhaps man vs. the supernatural make an appearance.
      I am looking forward to the next part and am curious to see how the work is concluded.

  explanation: >
      For anyone who has seen episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, you will be familiar with his playfulness with the plot to create suspense.
      I enjoyed Psycho more than I enjoyed Vertigo, and I wonder if it is the better film. Everyone played their roles perfectly, and Anthony Perkins was the main attraction.
      The way this movie is structured is not only smart, but contrarian and subversive. There are not many films that kill off the main character half way through the film.
      I imagine audiences during the time were caught off guard, expecting what is perhaps a crime drama, only to find that it was something closer to a psychological thriller.
      It is comes to no surprise that this influenced many directors in the succeeding generation.

      I remember the usage of proxy wars by PMC's within Metal Gear Solid 4 as a strong plot device, and wondered why the U.S. military was not as privatized when contractors were used to deliver products and services to be used by the military.
      Not surprisingly, there were more contractors in Afghanistan starting in 2007 than there were U.S. forces. Yet, for some reason, this information is covered in detail in the news or by the U.S. government.
      This video on the evolution of PMC's shows how they have played a larger and larger role in conflicts on the global scale. I not would be surprised if PMC's disrupt government militaries in the future by not only performing better, but working more efficiently without a large bureaucracy.
      While the concept may be troubling, I think it's only a matter of time for PMC's to do to the military what Space X has begun to do to NASA and ROSCOSMOS.

  explanation: >
      This is a hard, time consuming read that is dense with ideas. The book introduces us to System 1 and System 2 which are the two systems that govern how how thinking and brain power is allocated.
      These two systems are used as the basis of explaining many of the insufficiencies of the human mind. Topics such as the limitations of intuition, inability to maximize utility, and the superseding of rational thought by emotional reactions are covered.
      While the book may read like a textbook, it is very thought provoking. The implications extend to all aspects of our society and may explain why certain policies are favored in government, why one interview candidate was chosen over the other, even if the other choice is objectively better than what was ultimately chosen.

      Given the time this film was made, the director definitely had the choice of using color, but chose to use black and white. I feel that this was the correct decision.

      A series of interconnected stories about different people stuggling with different psychological disorders and mental illnesses with the only constant being Dr. Irabu the psychiatrist.
      The show uses a combination of different animation techniques such as rotoscoping and live action to better show many of the abstract thoughts the creators wished to convey and to better educate about the disorders including the outlining of any artistic licenses that have been taken.
      The experimental approach to the topics covered is growing more rare in the animation industry in Japan, but the care given to the work reinforces the case for greater risks to be taken in animation.
      Because many of the cases are specific to Japan, the show also manages to touch upon the collective unconcious of the country. I think Carl Jung would be proud.

      Also watched the game which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/cUTMhmVh1qs" target="_blank">here</a>.
      I felt like I had deja vu watching this, because, like the Lee Sedol vs Alphago games, I did not have a full understanding of the rules of the games.
      That said, it was exciting to watch just like the alphago games. This time, Deepmind set their sights on Starcraft II.
      What I found interesting about the AI was that it did not have as high of an APM as the pro players. It seemed to deliberately choose its actions.
      This most likely indicates that the pro players have many redundant actions.
      My guess is that the AI noticed patterns within the game that humans have overlooked.

      It's a sin to kill a mockingbird. I have never read this novel before, and after reading it, I can understand why it is part of many high school curriculums.
      While, many focus on its coverage of the treatment of African Americans during the depression era, the novel is a coming of age story at its heart that shows how nonsensical the world can be through a child's eyes.
      I found many of the characters to be convincing and well thought out. This was particularly the case with Atticus Finch who is shown to be a rare example of a principled man in a town with racist tendencies.
      I intend to watch the film in the near future.

      A highly educational series about the workings of the body that is very much in the vein of works such as Fantastic Voyage and Osmosis Jones.

      The series covers topics such as allergic reactions, food poisoning, and other inner body events that require an immune response.
      In terms of narrative, it is not the strongest, but within its genre, it is probably one of the best and makes what is usually a dry topic very interesting.

      The film adds to the source material with clever writing, great stop motion animation, and many of the quirks Wes Anderson is famous for.
      The voice acting by George Clooney and Meryl Streep suited the characters very well and added traits to the characters that was not described in the book.

      This is the first time I've viewed any of Osamu Hayashi's work. Japan has a constant focus on work, and the debt one owes society.
      However, in many cases, this can remove meaning from one's existence within society.
      Here, Hayashi Sensei discusses with many Neets who have performed well academically what it means to have a job, and why it is unreasonable to always expect for society to conform to your wishes.
      He also explores the topics within the context of his own life experiences and clearly outlines the differences between what one wants to do in life and what what can do in life.
      The conversation is nuanced and touches upon many different subjects and offers meaning to aspects of life that are usually never explored in depth in Japanese society.

      Siddhartha is written in a lyrical style and reads very similarly to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.

      The book is split into two parts. The first covers Viktor Frankl's time in the German concentration camps and the second covers logotherapy.
      The usage of Viktor Frankl's experience during the Holocaust to explain the significance of meaning was very powerful.
      I found logotherapy to be a more rational approach to psychotherapy and finding meaning to life than other approaches, but it does seem dated.
      A more modern approach might utilize statistics and mathematics to clearly outline patterns in human behavior.
      Overall, the way this work outlined purpose, the will to live, and the various perspectives by which to view suffering made it a useful read.

      I also recommend watching his talks with Joe Rogan and his recent appearance on Impact Theory.
      Using hypoxia to improve mental and bodily tolerances is something that I have never tried before, and the amount of added control it provides to the body makes it seem like a very valuable skill that is very similar to that which is exhibited by Shaolin monks.
      Wim Hof's insistence on taking rigorous metrics and scientifically analyzing everything has expelled any doubts that his technique can allow for the human body to overcome various limits.

      This was not an easy book to read due to my ignorance about Russian culture and history.
      That said, the plight of Raskolnikov was not only relatable, but it can be observed in one form or another in the lives of people today.
      Because of this, the philosophical underpinnings were not lost in translation or lost to time.
      The organization of the book may seem strange to some, because it switches its focus to its side characters frequently.
      While this may be interpretted as a flaw in the novel, the treatment of the Marmeladovs and Svidrigailov gives us a more complete study of human behavior that may not be exhibited by Raskolnikov.
      Dostoyevsky added an epilogue at the end. This, in my opinion, weakened the ending, and I recommend thoroughly skipping it.

      I personally did not enjoy this film or find it impressive at a critical level, but I think this may be depend on the person watching it.

      Horror movies usually don't affect me, but I found the imagery in this film to be more effective than other entries in the genre.
      Since this was directed by William Friedkin, great camera work is to be expected. I can see why this film had staying power more than 40 years after it was released.

      A fun film that offers a glimpse into the future where automation, robotics, and neural interfaces are beginning to become more ubiquitous.

      This book went by quickly not only because it was short, but also because it was well written.
      It provides in concrete terms the types of workouts David Goggins undergoes as well as an intro into the type of person Jesse Itzler is.
      The book offers a clear representation of the numbers that need to be reached and the attitude with which to approach tough problems to reach the level David Goggins operates at.

      I was in absolute awe of the animation style the entire duration of the film.
      The boundaries between 2d and 3d are seamlessly intertwined.
      The hip hop soundtrack was much appreciated.
      As someone who read many of the Spiderverse comics, I found this to be thoroughly enjoyable, and to have a great story.
      Even if you aren't a fan of the source material, I feel that there is a lesson for everyone to take away from this movie.
      Although this is missing characters like Silk, Anya, and Jessica Drew, I think their exclusion worked to the benefit of the film by preventing things from getting too complicated.
      If the end credits is anything to go by, we'll have a sequel and I am looking forward to it.

  explanation: >
      My first Walter Isaacson biography. It covers Benjamin Franklin's life from beginning to end.
      I found that I learned quite a bit about colonial and post independence America that I did not learn in grade school.
      In school, our knowledge tends to be very America specific, so global events, France's involvement and Canada are covered in very little detail if any.
      I also found the tips and tricks that Benjamin Franklin developped in regards to work to be very useful. Overall, I learned that Franklin's achievements extend past his actions during America's Revolutionary war.
      Not only was he a politician, but he was a scientist, a printer, and a well rounded person who influenced many things we take for granted today.

  explanation: >
      Watched the livestream on Dec 18 as well. You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/nSIzsMlwMUY" target="_blank">here</a>. The test tunnel is very proof of concept.
      The electric skates in the simulation are gone and replaced with a set of wheels that are attached to a Tesla.
      The tunnel itself was disappointing, but the highlight of the show is the many-fold gains made in tunneling and boring technology.
      I'm hoping that the actual tunnels are a far more refined and practical.

  explanation: >
      It seems like there are a lot of things happening even as we are finishing up the year.
      VSS Unity went past what the United States Air Force defines as the Kármán line. With this success, I am hoping the we can get more sophisticated aeronautics in the mainstream.
      I am hoping that we'll not only be using this for tourism, but also for high speed air travel in the future in a way that is similar to Space X's BFR Earth to Earth plan.

  explanation: >
      A somewhat sad film that brought back a few bad memories while I was watching it. That said, it is short and simple.
      It does not dwell on topics, but it also does not shy away from the troubles faced by many of the children in the foster home.
      The stop motion animation is clean and vibrant. I recommend it not only for children, but for adults as well. There is something here for everyone.

  explanation: >
      It seems like many of the works I've been consuming lately deals with life and death. Daytripper is a work that has a unique device where the main character dies at the end of each issue during different points in his life.
      Daytripper not only discusses the important life changing moments that can result in the rebirth of one's identity, but also the fact that everyone will die. In many cases, it treads similar ground as Siddhartha Gautama, but it offers a more personal and modern touch that may make it easier to relate to.

  explanation: >
      I think this is the first Swedish film I have ever seen. Although this film is not fast paced, it does not drag on and moves from scene to scene with purpose.
      Themes of Death and God are tackled in this film and are handled very well. Even though it is in black and white, images have staying power and are carefully thought out.
      In many ways, it makes me feel like it is an older version of Death Parade and may actually be one of the sources of inspiration that Death Parade drew from.

  explanation: >
      This video from VICE begins with a demonstration of what a malicious attacker is capable of when they take advantage of vulnerabilities in a self driving car.
      We live in a time where cybersecurity is growing in importance. Israel and it's military and private institutions are growing and attaining global dominance in these areas.
      Usually, we think of the U.S., Russia, China, and the U.K.'s GCHQ as the giants in the security arena. Now, it must be acknowledged that Israel is a powerful force in intelligence and cyber warfare.
      Recently, we've seen glimpses of Israel's power in Snowden's files, and Harvey Weinsteins' hiring of Black Cube. With the growth of private companies in Israel, I expect the frequency of Israeli firms in the news to only increase.

  explanation: >
      A soft introduction into deep learning in the context of self driving cars. This is a class that is led by Lex Fridman. I found this to be highly interesting.
      It includes talks by people in the industry and not only covers the technical aspects of the field, but also how policy and business is changing to accomodate the changes.
      Also includes a very simple example that helped me better understand how gradient descent and backpropogation works. You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/nFTQ7kHQWtc?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

      A film that I was told should be required viewing for any office worker. It wasn't as funny as I expected it to be, but I enjoyed it all the same. I found that it did not connect as well because it takes place in the late 90's. That could just be the effect of a generational gap.

      A book that covers the Nanking Massacre in great detail. The novel is split into three parts that details the event from the perspective of the Chinese, the Japanese, and foreigners that were in Nanking during the time.
      The contents of this book were heavy, and the descriptions of many of the war crimes that occured were difficult to stomach. Iris Chang wrote a compelling book, and it is unfortunate that she committed suicide. This book is not easy reading, but I feel that it is something that should be read so that we never forget what occurred.

  explanation: >
      Available on Gutenberg. This is a translation of the Lao Tzu's work. The Tao or the Dao is often contradictory and this is to be expected because of the inherent nature of yin and yang in the Taiji.
      In many cases, the teachings seem like common sense, but in some, the messages can seem cryptic or often unintuitive. For those who are unfamiliar with eastern philosophy, this can be difficult to conceptually grasp.
      One thing that I found interesting was that I could see some of concepts that would later show up in Confucianism. Concepts such as humility which are very common in east Asian cultures can be found here.

      12 rules for making more sense of the world. This was intended to be a more accessible version of Maps of Meaning, but I found that this read less like a helpful guide and more like a series of essays.

      A film that may not appeal to everyone. It's a slow moving, but stylistic and beautiful film. Shots are well constructed and thoughtfully paced. It's scarce on plot, but high on artistry.

  explanation: >
      A work of art that I believe should deserve more attention. There are not many works that cover topics such as heaven and hell as well as life and death. The emphasis on the void and reincarnation diverges from the traditional themes of good and evil that can be found in monotheistic religion.
      As a result, a more nuanced interpretation of the topics is provided in the show. This is a show that I believe can appeal to a critic's sensibility as well as to the mainstream. Every detail seems purposeful and well thought out.
      In my opinion, this is the best anime I've seen so far this year.

      A show with great animation and art style. The ambitions of many of the competitors were tastefully covered and effectively carried emotions and tones in unconventional ways.
      A highly recommended series that gets easily overlooked because of artistic choices that don't conform to mainstream tastes.

      After 14 years, Red Bull BC One returns to Switzerland. I found this world final to be easier to digest compared to last year's world final.
      Although the judging seemed questionable, it was still an enjoyable experience. Lil Zoo is a skilled bboy with tenure. The inclusion of the bgirl world final was also appreciated.

      Reading this was a chore. I read Walden due to references made to it in Shane Carruth's Upstream Color. I found that it was redundant and many times contradictory. That said, it was impressive how many different ways Henry David Thoreau was able to state his appreciation of nature and the outdoors.

      The first season was what got me started with my current routine of waking up at 4:30 and going to the gym. So, I have a bit of attachment to this series.
      The second season is just as good in my opinion. Because it is a shounen anime, the concept of incremental progress is baked right into the themes driving the show.
      This Japanese take on the superhero genre is unique and it has heart.

  explanation: >
      I played through the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection in Japanese, Ground Zeros on PS4 and The Phantom Pain on ps3.
      Because of that, I thought it would be strange for me to play this last. Despite this, I found MGS to be one of the best in the series and thoroughly enjoyable despite its age.
      The care given to Sniper Wolf made her one of my most favorite characters in the series. Although I played the integral version, I think the game should play well on any console because of the simple controls.
      This is a cinematic game that I think anyone will be able to enjoy.

      A great time waster where the animators and the voice actors basically just had fun with the whole concept.
      Episodes are about 12 minutes each, making it a nice way to fill time.

      Similar to Saiki Kusuo and One Punch Man. Since it was made by the same person as One Punch Man, you will find many similarities.

  explanation: >
      Multivariable Calculus for Khan Academy. Covers topics such as partial derivatives, gradients, curl, divergence, triple integrals, line integrals, etc.
      Not all of the content has been committed to long term memory, but important concepts like a partial and a gradient have stuck. One thing I underestimated was how much of a time suck this would be. Each video is about 10-15 minutes.
      After this, I'll probably move onto linear algebra, or physics.

  explanation: >
      Scalable and accurate simulation of light within a virtual environment. If the technology continues at the same pace, we'll hopefully have photorealistic computer graphics in films within 5 years and the same for video games within 10-15 years.
      This will allow for the immersive nature of VR and AR to increase tremendously. Now, all we need are sophisticated haptic feedback systems or neural links to allow for better interaction with the virtual environments.
      That said, I would have liked to have seen some info about graphics cards for consumers.

      Played this in English. Many people view this title with nostalgia. Although this is a solid turn based rpg, I didn't feel that it aged well.
      Compared to other 3d titles, the visuals were not the best and took away from the depth offered by the combat system and detailed story. I can see why this is being remade.
      After finishing this, I recommend watching Advent Children. Althoough the story may be convoluted, the characters make up for it with their uniqueness and originality.

      This was recommended to me by the instructor of a creative writing course that I took while I was in university. I put off watching this for a while, and I regret doing so. Brie Larson was great, but the star of the film was Jacob Tremblay. His performance was probably the best I've ever seen out of a child actor.

      I played the gamecube version of this on the dolphin emulator with a 3rd party xbox controller formatted like a ps4 controller.
      It is easy to tell why this is one of the greatest games ever made.
      In addition to bringing the Zelda franchise into the 3rd dimension, this game boasts great level design, and finely tuned controls.
      The music is iconic, and the characters are memorable. This game has aged well.
      It appeals to players of all ages and backgrounds, and has something to offer to anyone who picks up the controller and gives it a go.
      The playtime is over 30 hours, so you won't need to worry about it ending too soon.

  explanation: >
      In this sequel, the budget is higher and the jokes are more expensive. Deadpool is no longer something new, so it is interesting to see how they try to keep him fresh.
      In terms of the script, the quality is about the same as first, but there are times when it drags. If it was shortened slightly, it would be a tight film.

      Watched in Imax. A film that is the culmination of three phases of films in the Marvel cinematic universe.
      Although it may be lacking in story, it more than makes up for it with its scale and the ambitious plot that brings together all of the characters in the marvel universe.
      In addition to this, it finally brings Thanos to the forefront and provides him with greater depth than he had in the comics. I saw the first Avengers film when I was in high school, so the payoff was particularly rewarding to me.

      One of the most memorable events of the year. I never thought the rocket would successfully take off. The climax was the simultaneous landing of the side boosters.
      It would have been nice to see the center core land on the droneship, but 2/3 is still great. The shot of starman floating off into space was a good touch.
      Space x's have been continuously getting better over the years and this launch proved that they could not only nail the launch, but the telemetry as well.

      Saw this in imax. Great film. Although this was not my favorite Nolan film, it easily is one of the most well made among his works.
      The shots of the fighter planes were the most technical and impressive scenes in the film. Hans Zimmer's usage of the Shepard's tone could have been more emphasized.
      I actually did not realize that a Shepard's tone was used until looking it up after the fact. Because of how drawn out the auditory illusion was, in many cases, it felt as if the effect of the illusion was diminished.
