  explanation: >
      I actually liked it.
      It covered the sensitive topic of growing up very well and managed to do that through Bambi's experiences through the four seasons.
      Unlike Dumbo, this felt quite a bit more polished. You can really tell that it is a product of its time.
      The songs weren't made with commercial success in mind, and the characters weren't created with merchandise on the brain.
      If you were to compare it with The Lion King, you can find some of Bambi's DNA in the Lion King and other succeeding works.

      It is so cool to watch an interesting concept be implemented so well.
      The actors age as time passes, and it does not feel like the cast is actually acting.
      The time where the characters grew up was the same time I grew up, so I found it very easy to relate.
      Instead of using digital cameras, film was used, and this allowed for the quality of the picture to stay consistent.
      I believe that this should be required viewing for any student of film due to its innovation and execution.

      I'm not sure what to say other than that the series is consistently good and that you can't seem to go wrong with it.
      The second arc of this season was great, but it weakened in the final arcs.
      If you view the series as one continuous story instead of splitting it between seasons, you may find it more enjoyable.
      All Might gets pushed to the limit and the stakes are raised higher and higher as all the characters gain greater skill in their journey to become superheroes.
      It has its ups and downs, but I consider the time spent watching it to be worth it.

  explanation: >
      This book covers quite a bit of ground. It covers the Tarahumara who are exceptionally skilled at long distance running. It covers how central running is to being human.
      It introduces us to the world of ultra marathons, and it also discusses the disadvantages of shoes due to how they restrict our feet and increase the chances of injuries.
      While the writing can come across a little strong due to how it tries to tell a story instead of just present the facts, this also helps to make the read a little more enjoyable.
      What I took away from this is the following: run many miles to become good at running, be consistent, use shoes that does not restrict the toes and provides as flat a surface as possible.

      Kara no Kyoukai was a highly influential work for me, and I am glad that I can finally view the final movie in the series.
      The film covers the nature of the future and how prediction may be a less magical phenomenon than may appear at first glance.
      Like the other movies in the series, due to the achronological nature of the series as a whole, this film manages to not only tell a compelling, thought provoking story, but also provides what can be seen as a great conclusion or continuation of the series.

      I'm not a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's Hollywood films, but this has all the makings of a classic.
      While Paul Verhoeven is unable to do subtlety all that well like usual, this has a story that has enough momentum to avoid stumbling over the mistakes that it might make.
      Camera work and scenes are shot very well. All in all, it is a solid film that displays much of what makes the Dutch people who they are today and offers a good explanation of the resistance movements in the Netherlands during Nazi occupation.

  explanation: >
    Oh boy, I have a lot to say about this one. First, where is my Trojan Horse? I read the Alexander Pope translation which made the read a struggle in the beginning.
    Luckily, I have read The Rape of the Lock before, so I gradually got over the difficult English and began to appreciate the masterful usage of the English language to maintain the poetic qualities of the epic.
    Roman and Greek names are used interchangeably which caused much confusion as well.
    The actual story is bloody, and sometimes nonsensical.
    The gods don't always behave rationally, and sometimes they can be bested in battle by mortals.
    The fact that Achilles pretty much singlehandedly turned the tide of battle towards the later part of the story made for a very strangely paced work.
    There are many characters and not all of them are introduced. You really need to read the rest of the Epic Cycle to truly gain a proper understanding of what is going on.
    Overall, it is great for a poem spread through oral tradition, but as an actual story, I found it lacking by modern standards. If you want something better, I recommend Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Mahabharata.

      James Clear not only covers the compounding benefits of building habits on top of habits, but also presents the idea that systems are far more effective than goals.

      My journey into the world of Disney 2d Animated films begins with Dumbo.
      For 1941, the work is impressive, but an experienced viewer will notice that the animators were focused mainly on the animation and music.
      The sound design and the story were not given as much attention. Not all movements by the animated characters have a sound, and because the story was simple enough, there was not as much effort placed there.
      I couldn't figure out if the crows at the end were a racist caricature or not. It seems like others have mixed opinions about them as well.

      A highly underrated film.
      This was created during a time when backgrounds and animations were carefully drawn by hand and technology did not allow as many shortcuts as they do now.
      While they could have gone for spectacle like many other Japanese animated films during the time, this work carefully navigates many topics such as the cold war, class warfare, and religion and frames those topics within the context of space travel.
      The storytelling is its strong point, but the animation and the score are able to stand up as prime examples of their medium.

      The first entry in the Foundation trilogy covers the creation of the Foundation and the first century of its development.
      While I understand that this is an influential work of science fiction, I can't help but feel as if many of the concepts presented are quite dated or unrealistic.
      I find it strange that thousands of years in the future, we will have space faring monarchies, and that nuclear power will by the prime method of generating energy.
      In addition to this, I find it unrealistic that we would still be humanoids and struggle with many of the things we struggle with now.
      If one were to ignore all this, it does have the workings of a great political drama that takes place in space.

  explanation: >
      I was avoiding the last episode for a decent amount of time and it did not disappoint with the brutal amount of emotional weight it dumped on me.
      Made in Abyss might appear accessible to children on first glance, but this is a series that is mercilessly realistic in regards to the unforgiving nature of the world.
      To summarize Made in Abyss in a single sentence: two children journey to the depths of hell. The story is shown as an adventure into the abyss in search of the truth.
      With solid world building, this series beautifully displays the hero's journey in its entirety-- good parts and bad.
      Watching this reminded me of many greater works I have read in the past as well as historical tragedies: Dante's Inferno, Nietzsche, human experimentation during the Holocaust, and Grimm's Fairy Tales.
      The deep themes combined with Kevin Penkin's sophisticated score made this a very impactful story for me.

  explanation: >
      Juno was surprising in that it had an overqualified cast and a script that is great during most of the film (although sometimes it does feel like it is trying too hard at times).
      The delivery of dialogue is quick and deadly. Camera work is above mediocre.
      I'm not sure if the film was trying to be hip or come across as quirky, but this sometimes backfires when it takes away from the emotional punch that can be delivered by the situation of unexpected teen pregnancy.
      Despite all this, I don't think that there is any other film like it and because of the short runtime, there isn't much to lose if the film doesn't connect.

      On its own merits, I don't see what the big deal is. Half Life 2 was a better game.
      What this game did have going for it was good level design.
      Story-wise, it was better than other games during the time, but it's nothing to write home about.
      While the player is given multiple weapons, they don't really add any new mechanics to the gameplay.

      A classy noir film that is very similar to L.A. Confidential, L.A. Noir and The Maltese Falcon.
      Unlike those films, this is arguably darker and more unforgiving.
      I don't understand why, but 1970's films seem to have been more willing to take darker and more depressing turns compared to previous decades.
      This increase in realism allows for an easier suspension of disbelief and a smoother film to follow from the perspective of the viewer.

      In many companies, the creative element needed to introduce interesting new products tends to be stifled, and in most they are not fostered.
      While it is unclear whether Google's approach is the best, what is clear is that the company takes risks and is more fluid than most companies of its size.
      Due to this, it manages to act as an example that helps to disprove many commonly held beliefs about how a company needs to be run to achieve success.

  explanation: >
      Halo 2 expands upon Halo: Combat Evolved by continuing the story, adding weapons, new enemies, dual wielding, and other combat mechanics.
      The game is solid, the story explores the inner politics of the covenant, and ends with a cliffhanger.
      While I don't approve of the cliffhanger, it makes for a great way to sell the third game. I hope that I can one day finish the fight.

  explanation: >
      I am starting to view movies not just based on critical acclaim, but also keeping cultural impact in mind.
      Mean girls is a movie that has had great impact on modern American culture.
      Going into this, I was expecting it to be more family friendly, but the contents are suprisingly mature given the high school setting.
      In many ways, this movie is very similar to Easy A, but it focuses more on highschool cliques than on just popularity.
      I think Easy A is the better movie, but both are close in quality.
      The only major problem with Mean Girls I can think of is that it feels somewhat dated with cliques and types that have gone extinct in the 2000's.

  explanation: >
      The first step in achieving anything is the intention of achieving that thing.
      Think and Grow Rich emphasizes the importance of mindset and how it leads everything and can ultimately lead to success.
      Although Napoleon Hill has not accomplished much himself, this book and the modern edits has some useful information.
      It also showed me how similar many self-help books are.
      I intend to take a long hiatus from books in this genre just because of diminishing returns.

  explanation: >
      I feel conflicted about this book.
      While I do agree that the American education system does not teach the right things, I feel like this book does not either.
      Advice can be vague and sometimes even counterproductive. An example of this is Robert Kiyosaki's praising of multi-level marketing.
      In many ways, it reads very similarly to The Art of the Deal, and does not provide enough concrete action items to work from.
      I agree that financial education should be more important. I agree that you shouldn't work for your money and that your money should work for you.
      However, the contents of this book felt more like a sales pitch for a class than something that people can use.

  explanation: >
      This film is many things. It is a series of interconnected coming of age stories.
      It is a bunch of adventures simultaneously occurring at the same time.
      It is a stylized representation of an era.
      Watching this reminded me that George Lucas used to be a good director, and the writing had stylistic elements and quirks that viewers might recognize in A New Hope.

  explanation: >
      I think the last time I found myself with a deep sense of saudade with a video game was after finishing the Mass Effect series about three years ago.
      That was exactly how I felt when I saw the credits roll the end of FFVI.
      From beginning to end, the game had something to offer in the form of a great story, and memorable characters.
      Because of this, I was sad to see it end. The game had great pacing, kept the grinding to a minimum, and was filled with worlds of exploration.
      It was ambitious, not only in its story, but in its refusal to center itself on a main character.
      Each character was given care and attention which made the payoff at the end all the more worth the hours poured in by the player.
      The creators knew exactly what they were doing when they named you the player as one of the characters in this SNES epic.

  explanation: >
      This took about 4-5 months to complete and after finishing it, there are areas that I find to be shaky.
      This isn't all that surprising considering that the math involved is difficult to conceptually understand.
      That said, I find it fascinating that the primary building blocks of linear algebra are the skills that we build in Algebra 1.
      By completing this, I improved my understanding of matrices, vectors, and alternate coordinate bases.
      I also gained a better understanding of what my weak areas are.
      I think the next step to take, in my case, is to improve my ability to complete and understand proofs.

      I unfortunately could not watch this live due to the time difference. I recommend watching the post launch press conference as well.
      Now that Crew Dragon has been successfully launched, the next step will be to ensure that it can correctly dock and to test with real passengers.
      I can't wait to see how ULA responds. Between the crewed demos, the upcoming Starhopper tests, and Falcon Heavy launches, I'm not sure what I'm most looking forward to.

  explanation: >
      A conversation with Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang.
      It covers universal basic income in detail as well as what it can look like when UBI is implemented.
      Given the rate of technological improvement and automation, the economy and government policy is not evolving quickly enough to compensate.
      Seeing how this is already a problem, it is interesting to see someone try to attack the problem.
      While I am not sure how far he will go, I'm looking forward to seeing Andrew Yang in the Democratic presidential primary debates.

  explanation: >
      A book that teaches how to win favor and positive opinions from others. Many of the items here are common sense, but there are rules here that I think anyone can find useful.
      That said, the contents of this book may not apply well to countries other than the U.S., so tread with caution when applying the teachings in this book.
      Another thing to note is that it is not always advantageous to expend energy to appear favorable to everyone.
      It is just as important to choose who you want to be friends with and who you want to influence.
      Failure to do so can result in coming across as fake and possibly superficial.

  explanation: >
      This film did not have the greatest start, but picked up in quality as we started getting into the meat of the story.
      Dallas Buyers Club takes place in Texas during the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and follows the story of Ron Woodroof who worked to get medication to help AIDS patients when treatments were still in development in the U.S..
      While it may not be historically accurate, it manages to capture the tragic nature of living with AIDS with the great acting.
      Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey's performances were what carried this movie.

  explanation: >
      Violet Evergarden is a series focused on the intentions infused into letters.
      The creators handle this subject matter with an appropriate amount of sensitivity through the fluidity and detail in the animation.
      Episodes cover the topic in a simple manner by focusing on the writer, the recipients, the process of writing, delivery, and how the letters are affected by the times in which they are written.
      In addition to this, the usage of letters as a motif that is used as an engine for character development is nothing short of masterful.
      In this day and age where physical letters are becoming more rare, this show manages to remind us of how humans can connect with one another.
