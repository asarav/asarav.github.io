  explanation: >
      This book covers quite a bit of ground. It covers the Tarahumara who are exceptionally skilled at long distance running. It covers how central running is to being human.
      It introduces us to the world of ultra marathons, and it also discusses the disadvantages of shoes due to how they restrict our feet and increase the chances of injuries.
      While the writing can come across a little strong due to how it tries to tell a story instead of just present the facts, this also helps to make the read a little more enjoyable.
      What I took away from this is the following: run many miles to become good at running, be consistent, use shoes that does not restrict the toes and provides as flat a surface as possible.

      It's not a good movie. It's not even a great one. But at least it had a Trojan horse. Other than that, it was a complete waste of 3 hours.

  explanation: >
      Kara no Kyoukai was a highly influential work for me, and I am glad that I can finally view the final movie in the series.
      The film covers the nature of the future and how prediction may be a less magical phenomenon than may appear at first glance.
      Like the other movies in the series, due to the achronological nature of the series as a whole, this film manages to not only tell a compelling, thought provoking story, but also provides what can be seen as a great conclusion or continuation of the series.

  explanation: >
      I'm not a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's Hollywood films, but this has all the makings of a classic.
      While Paul Verhoeven is unable to do subtlety all that well like usual, this has a story that has enough momentum to avoid stumbling over the mistakes that it might make.
      Camera work and scenes are shot very well. All in all, it is a solid film that displays much of what makes the Dutch people who they are today and offers a good explanation of the resistance movements in the Netherlands during Nazi occupation.

  explanation: >
      It's not often that I read what is essentially a text book from cover to cover, but I wanted to improve my skills as a writer so I picked this up.
      Topics are covered in simple and digestible pieces. This made it easy to comprehend and made the grammar rules presented easier to remember.
      This book not only helps with grammar, but also covers what makes one's writing more effective.

  explanation: >
    Oh boy, I have a lot to say about this one. First, where is my Trojan Horse? I read the Alexander Pope translation which made the read a struggle in the beginning.
    Luckily, I have read The Rape of the Lock before, so I gradually got over the difficult English and began to appreciate the masterful usage of the English language to maintain the poetic qualities of the epic.
    Roman and Greek names are used interchangeably which caused much confusion as well.
    The actual story is bloody, and sometimes nonsensical.
    The gods don't always behave rationally, and sometimes they can be bested in battle by mortals.
    The fact that Achilles pretty much singlehandedly turned the tide of battle towards the later part of the story made for a very strangely paced work.
    There are many characters and not all of them are introduced. You really need to read the rest of the Epic Cycle to truly gain a proper understanding of what is going on.
    Overall, it is great for a poem spread through oral tradition, but as an actual story, I found it lacking by modern standards. If you want something better, I recommend Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Mahabharata.

  explanation: >
      Atomic Habits breaks down what is needed to build positive habits and remove negative ones to reach success.
      Everything here makes sense and is presented in a way that is easy to implement.
      There are many important ideas presented here.
      James Clear not only covers the compounding benefits of building habits on top of habits, but also presents the idea that systems are far more effective than goals.
      There is a lot here that I can utilize on top of the system and process I currently use.

  explanation: >
      Remake of the original Tomb Raider. 
      For those who are not able to run the original Tomb Raider, this is a great alternative that fixes many of the problems in the first game.
      Although the level design may have suffered slightly, this holds up very well. It is easy to see where Uncharted gets its inspiration from.
      Tomb Raider is basically Uncharted with more of an emphasis on problem solving and less of an emphasis on story and cinematic thrills.

      I watched this due to its cultural significance and for the memes.
      It isn't anything groundbreaking, but I did laugh multiple times, and found it to be an above average American comedy.

  explanation: >
      My journey into the world of Disney 2d Animated films begins with Dumbo.
      For 1941, the work is impressive, but an experienced viewer will notice that the animators were focused mainly on the animation and music.
      The sound design and the story were not given as much attention. Not all movements by the animated characters have a sound, and because the story was simple enough, there was not as much effort placed there.
      I couldn't figure out if the crows at the end were a racist caricature or not. It seems like others have mixed opinions about them as well.

      A short 30 minute conversation conducted by Lex Fridman on the future of AI, computer vision, autonomous vehicles and the possibility of general purpose AI.

  explanation: >
      A highly underrated film.
      This was created during a time when backgrounds and animations were carefully drawn by hand and technology did not allow as many shortcuts as they do now.
      While they could have gone for spectacle like many other Japanese animated films during the time, this work carefully navigates many topics such as the cold war, class warfare, and religion and frames those topics within the context of space travel.
      The storytelling is its strong point, but the animation and the score are able to stand up as prime examples of their medium.

      3 out of 3. What Space X did not do the first time, they succeeded in doing the second time.
      Not only did they land all 3 boosters, but they managed to recover the fairing as well.
      That level of reusability is insane in a heavy lift vehicle. 20 years ago, this would have been considered near impossible.
