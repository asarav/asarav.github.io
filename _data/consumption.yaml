      Unlike Disney's offerings in the 40's, this felt a lot more polished.
      The animation is beautiful, and I can even see great implementations of rotoscoping in character movement.
      Any shortcomings in animation were successfully compensated by great background work.
      Despite Sleeping Beauty being part of an oversaturated genre, I found it enjoyable, but the characters could have been given more depth.

  explanation: >
      Better is a book about the struggles and triumphs of the medical system. He not only covers how medicine and treatment works in the U.S., but also in other countries like India.
      This provides a window into the challenges that are faced by practitioners.
      People sometimes forget that doctors need to worry about malpractice lawsuits and that diagnosis of an illness isn't quite as straight forward as it might seem in media.
      I found the end notes on how to be a positive deviant particularly useful.
      If you are planning on creating a startup that is centered on improving healthcare, understanding a doctor's experience can be very valuable.

      I actually liked it.
      It covered the sensitive topic of growing up very well and managed to do that through Bambi's experiences through the four seasons.
      Unlike Dumbo, this felt quite a bit more polished. You can really tell that it is a product of its time.
      The songs weren't made with commercial success in mind, and the characters weren't created with merchandise on the brain.
      If you were to compare it with The Lion King, you can find some of Bambi's DNA in the Lion King and other succeeding works.

  explanation: >
      It is so cool to watch an interesting concept be implemented so well.
      The actors age as time passes, and it does not feel like the cast is actually acting.
      The time where the characters grew up was the same time I grew up, so I found it very easy to relate.
      Instead of using digital cameras, film was used, and this allowed for the quality of the picture to stay consistent.
      I believe that this should be required viewing for any student of film due to its innovation and execution.

      I'm not sure what to say other than that the series is consistently good and that you can't seem to go wrong with it.
      The second arc of this season was great, but it weakened in the final arcs.
      If you view the series as one continuous story instead of splitting it between seasons, you may find it more enjoyable.
      All Might gets pushed to the limit and the stakes are raised higher and higher as all the characters gain greater skill in their journey to become superheroes.
      It has its ups and downs, but I consider the time spent watching it to be worth it.

  explanation: >
      This book covers quite a bit of ground. It covers the Tarahumara who are exceptionally skilled at long distance running. It covers how central running is to being human.
      It introduces us to the world of ultra marathons, and it also discusses the disadvantages of shoes due to how they restrict our feet and increase the chances of injuries.
      While the writing can come across a little strong due to how it tries to tell a story instead of just present the facts, this also helps to make the read a little more enjoyable.
      What I took away from this is the following: run many miles to become good at running, be consistent, use shoes that does not restrict the toes and provides as flat a surface as possible.

      Kara no Kyoukai was a highly influential work for me, and I am glad that I can finally view the final movie in the series.
      The film covers the nature of the future and how prediction may be a less magical phenomenon than may appear at first glance.
      Like the other movies in the series, due to the achronological nature of the series as a whole, this film manages to not only tell a compelling, thought provoking story, but also provides what can be seen as a great conclusion or continuation of the series.

  explanation: >
      I'm not a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's Hollywood films, but this has all the makings of a classic.
      While Paul Verhoeven is unable to do subtlety all that well like usual, this has a story that has enough momentum to avoid stumbling over the mistakes that it might make.
      Camera work and scenes are shot very well. All in all, it is a solid film that displays much of what makes the Dutch people who they are today and offers a good explanation of the resistance movements in the Netherlands during Nazi occupation.

  explanation: >
    Oh boy, I have a lot to say about this one. First, where is my Trojan Horse? I read the Alexander Pope translation which made the read a struggle in the beginning.
    Luckily, I have read The Rape of the Lock before, so I gradually got over the difficult English and began to appreciate the masterful usage of the English language to maintain the poetic qualities of the epic.
    Roman and Greek names are used interchangeably which caused much confusion as well.
    The actual story is bloody, and sometimes nonsensical.
    The gods don't always behave rationally, and sometimes they can be bested in battle by mortals.
    The fact that Achilles pretty much singlehandedly turned the tide of battle towards the later part of the story made for a very strangely paced work.
    There are many characters and not all of them are introduced. You really need to read the rest of the Epic Cycle to truly gain a proper understanding of what is going on.
    Overall, it is great for a poem spread through oral tradition, but as an actual story, I found it lacking by modern standards. If you want something better, I recommend Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Mahabharata.

      James Clear not only covers the compounding benefits of building habits on top of habits, but also presents the idea that systems are far more effective than goals.

      My journey into the world of Disney 2d Animated films begins with Dumbo.
      For 1941, the work is impressive, but an experienced viewer will notice that the animators were focused mainly on the animation and music.
      The sound design and the story were not given as much attention. Not all movements by the animated characters have a sound, and because the story was simple enough, there was not as much effort placed there.
      I couldn't figure out if the crows at the end were a racist caricature or not. It seems like others have mixed opinions about them as well.

      A highly underrated film.
      This was created during a time when backgrounds and animations were carefully drawn by hand and technology did not allow as many shortcuts as they do now.
      While they could have gone for spectacle like many other Japanese animated films during the time, this work carefully navigates many topics such as the cold war, class warfare, and religion and frames those topics within the context of space travel.
      The storytelling is its strong point, but the animation and the score are able to stand up as prime examples of their medium.

      The first entry in the Foundation trilogy covers the creation of the Foundation and the first century of its development.
      While I understand that this is an influential work of science fiction, I can't help but feel as if many of the concepts presented are quite dated or unrealistic.
      I find it strange that thousands of years in the future, we will have space faring monarchies, and that nuclear power will by the prime method of generating energy.
      In addition to this, I find it unrealistic that we would still be humanoids and struggle with many of the things we struggle with now.
      If one were to ignore all this, it does have the workings of a great political drama that takes place in space.

  explanation: >
      I was avoiding the last episode for a decent amount of time and it did not disappoint with the brutal amount of emotional weight it dumped on me.
      Made in Abyss might appear accessible to children on first glance, but this is a series that is mercilessly realistic in regards to the unforgiving nature of the world.
      To summarize Made in Abyss in a single sentence: two children journey to the depths of hell. The story is shown as an adventure into the abyss in search of the truth.
      With solid world building, this series beautifully displays the hero's journey in its entirety-- good parts and bad.
      Watching this reminded me of many greater works I have read in the past as well as historical tragedies: Dante's Inferno, Nietzsche, human experimentation during the Holocaust, and Grimm's Fairy Tales.
      The deep themes combined with Kevin Penkin's sophisticated score made this a very impactful story for me.

  explanation: >
      Juno was surprising in that it had an overqualified cast and a script that is great during most of the film (although sometimes it does feel like it is trying too hard at times).
      The delivery of dialogue is quick and deadly. Camera work is above mediocre.
      I'm not sure if the film was trying to be hip or come across as quirky, but this sometimes backfires when it takes away from the emotional punch that can be delivered by the situation of unexpected teen pregnancy.
      Despite all this, I don't think that there is any other film like it and because of the short runtime, there isn't much to lose if the film doesn't connect.

      On its own merits, I don't see what the big deal is. Half Life 2 was a better game.
      What this game did have going for it was good level design.
      Story-wise, it was better than other games during the time, but it's nothing to write home about.
      While the player is given multiple weapons, they don't really add any new mechanics to the gameplay.

      A classy noir film that is very similar to L.A. Confidential, L.A. Noir and The Maltese Falcon.
      Unlike those films, this is arguably darker and more unforgiving.
      I don't understand why, but 1970's films seem to have been more willing to take darker and more depressing turns compared to previous decades.
      This increase in realism allows for an easier suspension of disbelief and a smoother film to follow from the perspective of the viewer.

  explanation: >
      This was an interesting read due to many companies adopting the practices that Google has-- my company included.
      In many companies, the creative element needed to introduce interesting new products tends to be stifled, and in most they are not fostered.
      While it is unclear whether Google's approach is the best, what is clear is that the company takes risks and is more fluid than most companies of its size.
      Due to this, it manages to act as an example that helps to disprove many commonly held beliefs about how a company needs to be run to achieve success.

      This novel is a tough but rewarding read that dives into the relations between heroes and our lives.
      It covers the many stories we tell and the similarities between all of them. The text is ripe with examples compiled from many different cultures.
      Because the story of the hero is in many ways the story of man, I found that by reading this, I not only learned about myths and religions, but of what the goals of man as an individual are.

      Halo 2 expands upon Halo: Combat Evolved by continuing the story, adding weapons, new enemies, dual wielding, and other combat mechanics.
      The game is solid, the story explores the inner politics of the covenant, and ends with a cliffhanger.
      While I don't approve of the cliffhanger, it makes for a great way to sell the third game. I hope that I can one day finish the fight.

  explanation: >
      I am starting to view movies not just based on critical acclaim, but also keeping cultural impact in mind.
      Mean girls is a movie that has had great impact on modern American culture.
      Going into this, I was expecting it to be more family friendly, but the contents are suprisingly mature given the high school setting.
      In many ways, this movie is very similar to Easy A, but it focuses more on highschool cliques than on just popularity.
      I think Easy A is the better movie, but both are close in quality.
      The only major problem with Mean Girls I can think of is that it feels somewhat dated with cliques and types that have gone extinct in the 2000's.

      The first step in achieving anything is the intention of achieving that thing.
      Think and Grow Rich emphasizes the importance of mindset and how it leads everything and can ultimately lead to success.
      Although Napoleon Hill has not accomplished much himself, this book and the modern edits has some useful information.
      It also showed me how similar many self-help books are.
      I intend to take a long hiatus from books in this genre just because of diminishing returns.

  explanation: >
      I feel conflicted about this book.
      While I do agree that the American education system does not teach the right things, I feel like this book does not either.
      Advice can be vague and sometimes even counterproductive. An example of this is Robert Kiyosaki's praising of multi-level marketing.
      In many ways, it reads very similarly to The Art of the Deal, and does not provide enough concrete action items to work from.
      I agree that financial education should be more important. I agree that you shouldn't work for your money and that your money should work for you.
      However, the contents of this book felt more like a sales pitch for a class than something that people can use.

      I think the last time I found myself with a deep sense of saudade with a video game was after finishing the Mass Effect series about three years ago.
      That was exactly how I felt when I saw the credits roll the end of FFVI.
      From beginning to end, the game had something to offer in the form of a great story, and memorable characters.
      Because of this, I was sad to see it end. The game had great pacing, kept the grinding to a minimum, and was filled with worlds of exploration.
      It was ambitious, not only in its story, but in its refusal to center itself on a main character.
      Each character was given care and attention which made the payoff at the end all the more worth the hours poured in by the player.
      The creators knew exactly what they were doing when they named you the player as one of the characters in this SNES epic.

      This took about 4-5 months to complete and after finishing it, there are areas that I find to be shaky.
      This isn't all that surprising considering that the math involved is difficult to conceptually understand.
      That said, I find it fascinating that the primary building blocks of linear algebra are the skills that we build in Algebra 1.
      By completing this, I improved my understanding of matrices, vectors, and alternate coordinate bases.
      I also gained a better understanding of what my weak areas are.
      I think the next step to take, in my case, is to improve my ability to complete and understand proofs.

      A book that teaches how to win favor and positive opinions from others. Many of the items here are common sense, but there are rules here that I think anyone can find useful.
      That said, the contents of this book may not apply well to countries other than the U.S., so tread with caution when applying the teachings in this book.
      Another thing to note is that it is not always advantageous to expend energy to appear favorable to everyone.
      It is just as important to choose who you want to be friends with and who you want to influence.
      Failure to do so can result in coming across as fake and possibly superficial.

      This film did not have the greatest start, but picked up in quality as we started getting into the meat of the story.
      Dallas Buyers Club takes place in Texas during the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and follows the story of Ron Woodroof who worked to get medication to help AIDS patients when treatments were still in development in the U.S..
      While it may not be historically accurate, it manages to capture the tragic nature of living with AIDS with the great acting.

      Violet Evergarden is a series focused on the intentions infused into letters.
      The creators handle this subject matter with an appropriate amount of sensitivity through the fluidity and detail in the animation.
      Episodes cover the topic in a simple manner by focusing on the writer, the recipients, the process of writing, delivery, and how the letters are affected by the times in which they are written.
      In addition to this, the usage of letters as a motif that is used as an engine for character development is nothing short of masterful.
      In this day and age where physical letters are becoming more rare, this show manages to remind us of how humans can connect with one another.

      This book introduces readers to the world of competitive memorization and some of the techniques one can use to remember things better.
      It covers in decent depth what memory is and what role it plays in our lives as well as the history of mnemonic technique.
      In addition to this, it also covers Joshua Foer's journey into the world of competitive memorization.
      While the book may read like a long article in a newspaper or magazine, it has useful information.
      Unfortunately, it is not an instructional guide to memorization and should not be treated as such.
      If you want to improve your mnemonic techniques, I recommend reading this book to introduce yourself to the world of memorization and then researching and practicing techniques on your own.

  explanation: >
      Aliens feels like what you would get if you crossed the original Alien with Die Hard and then scaled everything up.
      Although Aliens is more of an action film than sci-fi horror, James Cameron manages to keep much of what made the previous film great by only turning up the action in the second half of the film.
      For the first half, we don't see a single alien, and this allows for the maintaining of suspense as well as foreshadowing.
      While I prefer the original Alien because I prefer Ridley Scott's sensibilities, Aliens not only manages to match Alien in certain areas, but also manages to improve over Alien through its own unique qualities.

      There are not many films that take place in Antarctica, and there are even fewer that can take advantage of the setting in the way The Thing did.
      The Thing touches on themes of isolation, distrust, and combines them with a simple but solid premise.
      The special effects were impressive, and it is easy to see why this film influenced many horror directors as well as many Japanese directors such as Hideo Kojima and Takashi Miike.
      While it may not be particularly ground breaking, this is a good film that is wonderfully constructed.

      After reading The Lean Startup, I found myself questioning how in the world Theranos could survive for as long as it did.
      I suppose that proves how important the pitch and connections are. That said, it seemed like they did everything wrong except for PR and marketing.
      The executives did not listen to the engineers that worked on the testing machines, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani lied to investors and customers, the culture was toxic, and the concept of an mvp was completely foreign.
      All I can say after reading this book is that an idea with potential and the passion of many individuals went completely to waste.

      While many of his ideas are sound, if you have worked in development, you may not gain as much as others by reading this book.
      That said, his views on using the proper metrics, innovation, and the emphasis on the minimum viable product are lessons that are very useful in both new companies and established companies.
      Depending on your prior knowledge of agile, mvp's, innovation teams, process optimization and improvement, and startups in general, you may gain more from Peter Thiel's book than from Eric Ries'.

  explanation: >
      The series continues with quality that is consistent with previous seasons and arguably hits notes that have not been hit before in previous seasons.
      The focus this time around is not on what lies outside of the walls, but rather what lies within.
      The third season plays more like a political thriller and as a result is able to provide exposition about the kingdom with nuance instead of through more heavy handed methods.
      A pattern a keen viewer might notice is that the director is gradually cycling through the six types of conflict in literature. In previous seasons, man vs. nature and man vs. man was covered thoroughly.
      This season focuses on man vs. society and man vs. self. If the previews of season 3 part 2 are anything to go by, we will soon seen man vs. technology and perhaps man vs. the supernatural make an appearance.
      I am looking forward to the next part and am curious to see how the work is concluded.

  explanation: >
      For anyone who has seen episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, you will be familiar with his playfulness with the plot to create suspense.
      I enjoyed Psycho more than I enjoyed Vertigo, and I wonder if it is the better film. Everyone played their roles perfectly, and Anthony Perkins was the main attraction.
      The way this movie is structured is not only smart, but contrarian and subversive. There are not many films that kill off the main character half way through the film.
      I imagine audiences during the time were caught off guard, expecting what is perhaps a crime drama, only to find that it was something closer to a psychological thriller.
      It is comes to no surprise that this influenced many directors in the succeeding generation.

      I remember the usage of proxy wars by PMC's within Metal Gear Solid 4 as a strong plot device, and wondered why the U.S. military was not as privatized when contractors were used to deliver products and services to be used by the military.
      Not surprisingly, there were more contractors in Afghanistan starting in 2007 than there were U.S. forces. Yet, for some reason, this information is covered in detail in the news or by the U.S. government.
      This video on the evolution of PMC's shows how they have played a larger and larger role in conflicts on the global scale. I not would be surprised if PMC's disrupt government militaries in the future by not only performing better, but working more efficiently without a large bureaucracy.
      While the concept may be troubling, I think it's only a matter of time for PMC's to do to the military what Space X has begun to do to NASA and ROSCOSMOS.

  explanation: >
      This is a hard, time consuming read that is dense with ideas. The book introduces us to System 1 and System 2 which are the two systems that govern how how thinking and brain power is allocated.
      These two systems are used as the basis of explaining many of the insufficiencies of the human mind. Topics such as the limitations of intuition, inability to maximize utility, and the superseding of rational thought by emotional reactions are covered.
      While the book may read like a textbook, it is very thought provoking. The implications extend to all aspects of our society and may explain why certain policies are favored in government, why one interview candidate was chosen over the other, even if the other choice is objectively better than what was ultimately chosen.
      Daniel Kahneman also gave a talk at Google that you can view <a href="https://youtu.be/CjVQJdIrDJ0" target="_blank">here</a>.

      A series of interconnected stories about different people stuggling with different psychological disorders and mental illnesses with the only constant being Dr. Irabu the psychiatrist.
      The show uses a combination of different animation techniques such as rotoscoping and live action to better show many of the abstract thoughts the creators wished to convey and to better educate about the disorders including the outlining of any artistic licenses that have been taken.
      The experimental approach to the topics covered is growing more rare in the animation industry in Japan, but the care given to the work reinforces the case for greater risks to be taken in animation.
      Because many of the cases are specific to Japan, the show also manages to touch upon the collective unconcious of the country. I think Carl Jung would be proud.

      A text based browser game that tells a story through the environment that it builds rather than through expositions.
      Through its simplicity, it is able to keep the player's attention by incrementally building off of the mechanics that it gradually introduces.

      I think it would be interesting to create a browser game myself in the future.

      Also watched the game which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/cUTMhmVh1qs" target="_blank">here</a>.
      I felt like I had deja vu watching this, because, like the Lee Sedol vs Alphago games, I did not have a full understanding of the rules of the games.
      That said, it was exciting to watch just like the alphago games. This time, Deepmind set their sights on Starcraft II.
      What I found interesting about the AI was that it did not have as high of an APM as the pro players. It seemed to deliberately choose its actions.
      This most likely indicates that the pro players have many redundant actions.
      My guess is that the AI noticed patterns within the game that humans have overlooked.
      I recommend reading Deepmind's blog post about the event <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/" target="_blank">here</a>.
      It would be nice to see Deepmind's AI go head to head with OpenAI :)

  explanation: >
      It's a sin to kill a mockingbird. I have never read this novel before, and after reading it, I can understand why it is part of many high school curriculums.
      While, many focus on its coverage of the treatment of African Americans during the depression era, the novel is a coming of age story at its heart that shows how nonsensical the world can be through a child's eyes.
      I found many of the characters to be convincing and well thought out. This was particularly the case with Atticus Finch who is shown to be a rare example of a principled man in a town with racist tendencies.
      I intend to watch the film in the near future.

      A highly educational series about the workings of the body that is very much in the vein of works such as Fantastic Voyage and Osmosis Jones.
      The details are highly accurate, making the series a useful tool for learning about microbiology and immunology.
      The series covers topics such as allergic reactions, food poisoning, and other inner body events that require an immune response.
      In terms of narrative, it is not the strongest, but within its genre, it is probably one of the best and makes what is usually a dry topic very interesting.
      I recommend supplementing your viewing with Dr. Hope's Sick Notes commentary of the individual episodes.

      I remember reading the book as a child, so seeing the movie was a joy for me.
      The film adds to the source material with clever writing, great stop motion animation, and many of the quirks Wes Anderson is famous for.
      The voice acting by George Clooney and Meryl Streep suited the characters very well and added traits to the characters that was not described in the book.
      Because of the sophisticated writing, I feel that adults will enjoy this more than children.
      Overall, it is a great film that surprisingly manages to fit in a lot of story within its short running time.

      During Freshman orientation at U of M, this film and Moonrise Kingdom were playing.
      I chose to watch Moonrise Kingdom and always wanted to view this film afterwards, but never got the chance until now.
      Headhunters is a skillfully crafted thriller that effortlessly plays with suspense.
      The story covers an art thief who is on the run from the owner of one of the art pieces he stole: an above average cat and mouse thriller.
      While it never touches on any heavy themes, its pace makes it so that it never bores.

      This is the first time I've viewed any of Osamu Hayashi's work. Japan has a constant focus on work, and the debt one owes society.
      However, in many cases, this can remove meaning from one's existence within society.
      Here, Hayashi Sensei discusses with many Neets who have performed well academically what it means to have a job, and why it is unreasonable to always expect for society to conform to your wishes.
      He also explores the topics within the context of his own life experiences and clearly outlines the differences between what one wants to do in life and what what can do in life.
      The conversation is nuanced and touches upon many different subjects and offers meaning to aspects of life that are usually never explored in depth in Japanese society.
      If you understand Japanese, I recommend taking 30 min out of your day to view this video.

  explanation: >
      Siddhartha is written in a lyrical style and reads very similarly to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.
      One of the main themes of the novel is that wisdom cannot be taught, but that it must be gained through experience.
      The usage of Siddhartha as a foil to Gautama's philosophy offers nuance that can provide greater insight into what Samsara and Nirvana is.
      While it may come across as simplistic, I felt that the simple writing style allowed for better introspection.

      Great film and very well written. It's rated PG, but I have no idea why. Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw stole the show.
      Each of the characters were carefully considered and have unique qualities that make them memorable.
      Compared to many of the monster movies of today, this film was well thought out and carefully planned.
      We can see the deliberate style of Spielberg beginning to take shape here.

  explanation: >
      The book is split into two parts. The first covers Viktor Frankl's time in the German concentration camps and the second covers logotherapy.
      The usage of Viktor Frankl's experience during the Holocaust to explain the significance of meaning was very powerful.
      I found logotherapy to be a more rational approach to psychotherapy and finding meaning to life than other approaches, but it does seem dated.
      A more modern approach might utilize statistics and mathematics to clearly outline patterns in human behavior.
      Overall, the way this work outlined purpose, the will to live, and the various perspectives by which to view suffering made it a useful read.

      An introduction to Wim Hof and the power of his breathing technique.
      I also recommend watching his talks with Joe Rogan and his recent appearance on Impact Theory.
      Using hypoxia to improve mental and bodily tolerances is something that I have never tried before, and the amount of added control it provides to the body makes it seem like a very valuable skill that is very similar to that which is exhibited by Shaolin monks.
      Wim Hof's insistence on taking rigorous metrics and scientifically analyzing everything has expelled any doubts that his technique can allow for the human body to overcome various limits.
      It's a good thing that it's Winter right now, because it's the perfect time to test myself against the cold.

  explanation: >
      This was not an easy book to read due to my ignorance about Russian culture and history.
      That said, the plight of Raskolnikov was not only relatable, but it can be observed in one form or another in the lives of people today.
      Because of this, the philosophical underpinnings were not lost in translation or lost to time.
      The organization of the book may seem strange to some, because it switches its focus to its side characters frequently.
      While this may be interpretted as a flaw in the novel, the treatment of the Marmeladovs and Svidrigailov gives us a more complete study of human behavior that may not be exhibited by Raskolnikov.
      Dostoyevsky added an epilogue at the end. This, in my opinion, weakened the ending, and I recommend thoroughly skipping it.

      A conversation with Ben Goertzel the founder of SingularityNET. Unlike other AI researchers, Ben does not seem quite as dismissive of ideas that have originated in science fiction and Hollywood movies.
      As a result, the conversation reaches areas that may not be covered by other individuals who work in the field.
      One interesting thing that Ben noted during the conversation is that the apocalypse scenario with AI seems to originate in western culture and does not seem to be recognized as much of a problem in East Asia.
      This is a good podcast to go back to once in a while.

      This is not Steven Spielberg's best film.
      Although it may be lacking in terms of story and plot, the technical achievements and scale of the the set pieces are impressive.
      The accuracy with which locations in China are presented is one of its strengths.
      That said, the writing felt mediocre, and Christian Bale's acting could not save it. 
      I personally did not enjoy this film or find it impressive at a critical level, but I think this may be depend on the person watching it.

      Horror movies usually don't affect me, but I found the imagery in this film to be more effective than other entries in the genre.
      Since this was directed by William Friedkin, great camera work is to be expected. I can see why this film had staying power more than 40 years after it was released.
