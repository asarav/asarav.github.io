  explanation: >
      Written by Liu Ciuxin and translated by Ken Liu. There are some very well thought out and great concepts presented here.
      Aspects of communication between species separated by light year is covered in detail.
      The concept of a sophon or artificially intelligent proton was mind blowing.
      As a civilization begins to improve in sophistication, its ability to control things at the microlevel and eventually transcend dimensions is an inevitability.
      The way covers the techological advances of the Trisolaris civilization is creative and just on another level.
      The progress of civilization being split between stable and chaotic eras is also a great touch.
      The author truly understood how intelligent progress and science works and managed to also tie it in with the cultural roadblocks presented by the Chinese government.

  explanation: >
      This is such a weird imaginative film.
      I did not recognize Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice.
      That's how great his acting was.
      The practical effects, makeup and puppetry really sold the afterlife and gave it an identity of its own.
      This is a great example of Tim Burton's style and his unique directorial idiosyncrasies.

      Introduced the Blue Moon lander and the New Glenn.
      It was interesting to see Jeff Bezos present his ideas and how they differed from Musk's.
      While it is discouraging to see that they currently just seem to be retracing Space X's steps at a slower rate, the purpose of Blue Origin is fundamentally different, so this may be fine.
      Jeff Bezos is more of a big picture guy and he is focused more on space infrastructure than anything else.
      Musk on the other hand wants to go to Mars and seems to have a better understanding of the details involved to improve execution.

  explanation: >
      One of the higher rated Disney princess films, but I didn't understand the point of it.
      The fairy godmother showed up out of nowhere.
      The mice and other animals got more screen time than Cinderella.
      Like usual, the animation is well done, and human characters are fluidly animated due to rotoscoping.
      Cinderella is not a character with much depth and is only a vehicle for wish fulfillment unlike Beauty and the Beast.
      The prince is one dimensional here unlike what could be seen in Sleeping Beauty and newer films.
      There are some iconic songs here, but it boggles the mind that the film gets as much praise as it does.

  explanation: >
      About three weeks of intense reading was what it took to make it from one end of this book to the others.
      This is a book that is consistent throughout if you ignore Leo Tolstoy's philosophical musings.
      That said, his philosophical musings and justifications explain the purpose of this novel as well as the greater reasons as to why this novel was written.
      This novel covers everything. The rich, the poor, how war affects all, love, family, life and death.
      I remember thinking about reading this in highschool, but decided not to then because of the character count.
      For those who are intimidated by the more than 500 characters presented in this novel, you'll only need to focus on the main ones.
      Pierre, the Rostov's, the Bolkonsky's and the higher rank figures in the war are really what you'll need to remember.
      I recommend reading this great novel. You might be turned off because of its length, but as you start to dig in, you'll find that it is manageable due to the short chapter lenghts.
      This is a journey you will wish to never end, and luckily, it's so long that it feels like it doesn't.

  explanation: >
      A fitting conclusion to a decades worth of world building and story telling.
      Unlike other superhero films, it was not quite as predictable, and it seemed to check all the boxes for what I wanted for the penultimate film of phase 3.
      It had good moments, and it also made callbacks to films that were made earlier in the Marvel universe.
      In terms of scale, it wasn't quite as large as Infinity War, but I think that helped to keep the plot tight and prevent things from getting convoluted.
      I have no complaints. It's not a perfect film, but I think most people will leave theatres satisfied.

  explanation: >
      A near perfect Disney animated film. The animation is fluid, and the music is iconic and has survived over the years.
      The characters faces look lopsided, but I think that is more of a stylistic choice.
      It copies details from Sleeping Beauty and other predecessors.
      Overall, its qualities lie in the lack of mistakes, but it doesn't seem to do anything particularly groundbreaking.
      Its quality is consistent with the other great Disney films of its time.

  explanation: >
      The last time I saw a Makoto Shinkai film was about 5-6 years ago when I saw the beautiful Kotonoha no Niwa.
      In many ways, this feels almost like a thesis statement that Shinkai built up over his 10+ years of experience.
      The fluid animation and vibrant colors from his previous works can be seen here.
      The common themes of the distance between people and what separates them and brings them together is thoroughly explored through the main premise of trading places in dreams.
      In addition to this, he infuses Japanese culture and presents Japan in a very realistic way.
      It really is deserving of all the praise that it has received.

  explanation: >
      There is nothing else like it. The music was conducted by the legendary Leopold Stokowski, and the animation was on point.
      For 1940, this level of fluidity and abstractness in an animation is absolutely mind blowing.
      It's an experience that is unique and difficult to reproduce. It is one thing to film something and set it to music.
      It is another to animate something to music.
      In this work, the marriage of sound and image are treated in a highly expert fashion.

      There aren't many shows about running, but this is one of them and it is great.
      This was originally a book before it was adapted to a movie and finally into a show.
      I loved how it covered the personal journeys everyone experiences in running as well as the competitive scene involved in running long distance as a team.
      The soundtrack by Hayashi Yuki was great as well.

  explanation: >
      Watching this before I watch Endgame. Captain Marvel is a movie that tries to do many things. It hits some notes, but it does not hit all of them.
      There are enjoyable moments and moments where where it drags. There are great shots and scenes where the camerawork was not thought out all that well.
      The special effects are impressive as always. The way Samuel L. Jackson was made to look younger was something that I found to be techincally notable.
      I was skeptical of Brie Larson's casting, but she does well in her role as Carol Danvers. Overall, I liked it, but I thought it could have been better.
      My guess is that important scenes had to be edited out for the theatrical cut, because it felt like something was missing.

      Unlike Disney's offerings in the 40's, this felt a lot more polished.
      The animation is beautiful, and I can even see great implementations of rotoscoping in character movement.
      Any shortcomings in animation were successfully compensated by great background work.
      Despite Sleeping Beauty being part of an oversaturated genre, I found it enjoyable, but the characters could have been given more depth.

  explanation: >
      Better is a book about the struggles and triumphs of the medical system. He not only covers how medicine and treatment works in the U.S., but also in other countries like India.
      This provides a window into the challenges that are faced by practitioners.
      People sometimes forget that doctors need to worry about malpractice lawsuits and that diagnosis of an illness isn't quite as straight forward as it might seem in media.
      I found the end notes on how to be a positive deviant particularly useful.
      If you are planning on creating a startup that is centered on improving healthcare, understanding a doctor's experience can be very valuable.

  explanation: >
      I actually liked it.
      It covered the sensitive topic of growing up very well and managed to do that through Bambi's experiences through the four seasons.
      Unlike Dumbo, this felt quite a bit more polished. You can really tell that it is a product of its time.
      The songs weren't made with commercial success in mind, and the characters weren't created with merchandise on the brain.
      If you were to compare it with The Lion King, you can find some of Bambi's DNA in the Lion King and other succeeding works.

  explanation: >
      It is so cool to watch an interesting concept be implemented so well.
      The actors age as time passes, and it does not feel like the cast is actually acting.
      The time where the characters grew up was the same time I grew up, so I found it very easy to relate.
      Instead of using digital cameras, film was used, and this allowed for the quality of the picture to stay consistent.
      I believe that this should be required viewing for any student of film due to its innovation and execution.

      I'm not sure what to say other than that the series is consistently good and that you can't seem to go wrong with it.
      The second arc of this season was great, but it weakened in the final arcs.
      If you view the series as one continuous story instead of splitting it between seasons, you may find it more enjoyable.
      All Might gets pushed to the limit and the stakes are raised higher and higher as all the characters gain greater skill in their journey to become superheroes.
      It has its ups and downs, but I consider the time spent watching it to be worth it.

      This book covers quite a bit of ground. It covers the Tarahumara who are exceptionally skilled at long distance running. It covers how central running is to being human.
      It introduces us to the world of ultra marathons, and it also discusses the disadvantages of shoes due to how they restrict our feet and increase the chances of injuries.
      While the writing can come across a little strong due to how it tries to tell a story instead of just present the facts, this also helps to make the read a little more enjoyable.
      What I took away from this is the following: run many miles to become good at running, be consistent, use shoes that does not restrict the toes and provides as flat a surface as possible.

      The film covers the nature of the future and how prediction may be a less magical phenomenon than may appear at first glance.
      Like the other movies in the series, due to the achronological nature of the series as a whole, this film manages to not only tell a compelling, thought provoking story, but also provides what can be seen as a great conclusion or continuation of the series.

      I'm not a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's Hollywood films, but this has all the makings of a classic.
      While Paul Verhoeven is unable to do subtlety all that well like usual, this has a story that has enough momentum to avoid stumbling over the mistakes that it might make.
      Camera work and scenes are shot very well. All in all, it is a solid film that displays much of what makes the Dutch people who they are today and offers a good explanation of the resistance movements in the Netherlands during Nazi occupation.

  explanation: >
    Oh boy, I have a lot to say about this one. First, where is my Trojan Horse? I read the Alexander Pope translation which made the read a struggle in the beginning.
    Luckily, I have read The Rape of the Lock before, so I gradually got over the difficult English and began to appreciate the masterful usage of the English language to maintain the poetic qualities of the epic.
    Roman and Greek names are used interchangeably which caused much confusion as well.
    The actual story is bloody, and sometimes nonsensical.
    The gods don't always behave rationally, and sometimes they can be bested in battle by mortals.
    The fact that Achilles pretty much singlehandedly turned the tide of battle towards the later part of the story made for a very strangely paced work.
    There are many characters and not all of them are introduced. You really need to read the rest of the Epic Cycle to truly gain a proper understanding of what is going on.
    Overall, it is great for a poem spread through oral tradition, but as an actual story, I found it lacking by modern standards. If you want something better, I recommend Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Mahabharata.

      My journey into the world of Disney 2d Animated films begins with Dumbo.
      For 1941, the work is impressive, but an experienced viewer will notice that the animators were focused mainly on the animation and music.
      The sound design and the story were not given as much attention. Not all movements by the animated characters have a sound, and because the story was simple enough, there was not as much effort placed there.
      I couldn't figure out if the crows at the end were a racist caricature or not. It seems like others have mixed opinions about them as well.

      This was created during a time when backgrounds and animations were carefully drawn by hand and technology did not allow as many shortcuts as they do now.
      While they could have gone for spectacle like many other Japanese animated films during the time, this work carefully navigates many topics such as the cold war, class warfare, and religion and frames those topics within the context of space travel.
      The storytelling is its strong point, but the animation and the score are able to stand up as prime examples of their medium.

      The first entry in the Foundation trilogy covers the creation of the Foundation and the first century of its development.
      While I understand that this is an influential work of science fiction, I can't help but feel as if many of the concepts presented are quite dated or unrealistic.
      I find it strange that thousands of years in the future, we will have space faring monarchies, and that nuclear power will by the prime method of generating energy.
      In addition to this, I find it unrealistic that we would still be humanoids and struggle with many of the things we struggle with now.
      If one were to ignore all this, it does have the workings of a great political drama that takes place in space.

  explanation: >
      I was avoiding the last episode for a decent amount of time and it did not disappoint with the brutal amount of emotional weight it dumped on me.
      Made in Abyss might appear accessible to children on first glance, but this is a series that is mercilessly realistic in regards to the unforgiving nature of the world.
      To summarize Made in Abyss in a single sentence: two children journey to the depths of hell. The story is shown as an adventure into the abyss in search of the truth.
      With solid world building, this series beautifully displays the hero's journey in its entirety-- good parts and bad.
      Watching this reminded me of many greater works I have read in the past as well as historical tragedies: Dante's Inferno, Nietzsche, human experimentation during the Holocaust, and Grimm's Fairy Tales.
      The deep themes combined with Kevin Penkin's sophisticated score made this a very impactful story for me.
      I am wary and excited for the continuation and conclusion of this adventure.

  explanation: >
      Juno was surprising in that it had an overqualified cast and a script that is great during most of the film (although sometimes it does feel like it is trying too hard at times).
      The delivery of dialogue is quick and deadly. Camera work is above mediocre.
      I'm not sure if the film was trying to be hip or come across as quirky, but this sometimes backfires when it takes away from the emotional punch that can be delivered by the situation of unexpected teen pregnancy.
      Despite all this, I don't think that there is any other film like it and because of the short runtime, there isn't much to lose if the film doesn't connect.

      On its own merits, I don't see what the big deal is. Half Life 2 was a better game.
      What this game did have going for it was good level design.
      Story-wise, it was better than other games during the time, but it's nothing to write home about.
      While the player is given multiple weapons, they don't really add any new mechanics to the gameplay.
      Overall, the game is good, but I feel like it is overrated. The final boss was a pain to beat.

      A classy noir film that is very similar to L.A. Confidential, L.A. Noir and The Maltese Falcon.
      Unlike those films, this is arguably darker and more unforgiving.
      I don't understand why, but 1970's films seem to have been more willing to take darker and more depressing turns compared to previous decades.
      This increase in realism allows for an easier suspension of disbelief and a smoother film to follow from the perspective of the viewer.

      I can understand why it is praised by Iraq war veterans.
      Even though this game is more than 10 years old, it still feels ambitious and manages to hit most of the right notes.

      This was an interesting read due to many companies adopting the practices that Google has-- my company included.
      In many companies, the creative element needed to introduce interesting new products tends to be stifled, and in most they are not fostered.
      While it is unclear whether Google's approach is the best, what is clear is that the company takes risks and is more fluid than most companies of its size.
      Due to this, it manages to act as an example that helps to disprove many commonly held beliefs about how a company needs to be run to achieve success.

      Halo 2 expands upon Halo: Combat Evolved by continuing the story, adding weapons, new enemies, dual wielding, and other combat mechanics.
      The game is solid, the story explores the inner politics of the covenant, and ends with a cliffhanger.

  explanation: >
      I am starting to view movies not just based on critical acclaim, but also keeping cultural impact in mind.
      Mean girls is a movie that has had great impact on modern American culture.
      Going into this, I was expecting it to be more family friendly, but the contents are suprisingly mature given the high school setting.
      In many ways, this movie is very similar to Easy A, but it focuses more on highschool cliques than on just popularity.
      I think Easy A is the better movie, but both are close in quality.
      The only major problem with Mean Girls I can think of is that it feels somewhat dated with cliques and types that have gone extinct in the 2000's.

      The first step in achieving anything is the intention of achieving that thing.
      Think and Grow Rich emphasizes the importance of mindset and how it leads everything and can ultimately lead to success.
      Although Napoleon Hill has not accomplished much himself, this book and the modern edits has some useful information.
      It also showed me how similar many self-help books are.
      I intend to take a long hiatus from books in this genre just because of diminishing returns.

  explanation: >
      I feel conflicted about this book.
      While I do agree that the American education system does not teach the right things, I feel like this book does not either.
      Advice can be vague and sometimes even counterproductive. An example of this is Robert Kiyosaki's praising of multi-level marketing.
      In many ways, it reads very similarly to The Art of the Deal, and does not provide enough concrete action items to work from.
      I agree that financial education should be more important. I agree that you shouldn't work for your money and that your money should work for you.
      However, the contents of this book felt more like a sales pitch for a class than something that people can use.

      I think the last time I found myself with a deep sense of saudade with a video game was after finishing the Mass Effect series about three years ago.
      That was exactly how I felt when I saw the credits roll the end of FFVI.
      From beginning to end, the game had something to offer in the form of a great story, and memorable characters.
      Because of this, I was sad to see it end. The game had great pacing, kept the grinding to a minimum, and was filled with worlds of exploration.
      It was ambitious, not only in its story, but in its refusal to center itself on a main character.
      Each character was given care and attention which made the payoff at the end all the more worth the hours poured in by the player.
      The creators knew exactly what they were doing when they named you the player as one of the characters in this SNES epic.

      This took about 4-5 months to complete and after finishing it, there are areas that I find to be shaky.
      This isn't all that surprising considering that the math involved is difficult to conceptually understand.

      By completing this, I improved my understanding of matrices, vectors, and alternate coordinate bases.

      In addition to this, the usage of letters as a motif that is used as an engine for character development is nothing short of masterful.
      In this day and age where physical letters are becoming more rare, this show manages to remind us of how humans can connect with one another.

      In addition to this, it also covers Joshua Foer's journey into the world of competitive memorization.
      While the book may read like a long article in a newspaper or magazine, it has useful information.
      Unfortunately, it is not an instructional guide to memorization and should not be treated as such.

  explanation: >
      Aliens feels like what you would get if you crossed the original Alien with Die Hard and then scaled everything up.
      Although Aliens is more of an action film than sci-fi horror, James Cameron manages to keep much of what made the previous film great by only turning up the action in the second half of the film.
      For the first half, we don't see a single alien, and this allows for the maintaining of suspense as well as foreshadowing.
      While I prefer the original Alien because I prefer Ridley Scott's sensibilities, Aliens not only manages to match Alien in certain areas, but also manages to improve over Alien through its own unique qualities.

      There are not many films that take place in Antarctica, and there are even fewer that can take advantage of the setting in the way The Thing did.
      The Thing touches on themes of isolation, distrust, and combines them with a simple but solid premise.
      The special effects were impressive, and it is easy to see why this film influenced many horror directors as well as many Japanese directors such as Hideo Kojima and Takashi Miike.
      While it may not be particularly ground breaking, this is a good film that is wonderfully constructed.

      This was a book that went by very quickly. It read very similarly to Glenn Greenwald's No Place to Hide in terms of the general pacing and momentum the subject matter brings.
      After reading The Lean Startup, I found myself questioning how in the world Theranos could survive for as long as it did.
      I suppose that proves how important the pitch and connections are. That said, it seemed like they did everything wrong except for PR and marketing.
      The executives did not listen to the engineers that worked on the testing machines, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani lied to investors and customers, the culture was toxic, and the concept of an mvp was completely foreign.

  explanation: >
      The series continues with quality that is consistent with previous seasons and arguably hits notes that have not been hit before in previous seasons.
      The focus this time around is not on what lies outside of the walls, but rather what lies within.
      The third season plays more like a political thriller and as a result is able to provide exposition about the kingdom with nuance instead of through more heavy handed methods.
      A pattern a keen viewer might notice is that the director is gradually cycling through the six types of conflict in literature. In previous seasons, man vs. nature and man vs. man was covered thoroughly.
      This season focuses on man vs. society and man vs. self. If the previews of season 3 part 2 are anything to go by, we will soon seen man vs. technology and perhaps man vs. the supernatural make an appearance.
      I am looking forward to the next part and am curious to see how the work is concluded.

  explanation: >
      For anyone who has seen episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, you will be familiar with his playfulness with the plot to create suspense.
      I enjoyed Psycho more than I enjoyed Vertigo, and I wonder if it is the better film. Everyone played their roles perfectly, and Anthony Perkins was the main attraction.
      The way this movie is structured is not only smart, but contrarian and subversive. There are not many films that kill off the main character half way through the film.
      I imagine audiences during the time were caught off guard, expecting what is perhaps a crime drama, only to find that it was something closer to a psychological thriller.
      It is comes to no surprise that this influenced many directors in the succeeding generation.

      I remember the usage of proxy wars by PMC's within Metal Gear Solid 4 as a strong plot device, and wondered why the U.S. military was not as privatized when contractors were used to deliver products and services to be used by the military.
      Not surprisingly, there were more contractors in Afghanistan starting in 2007 than there were U.S. forces. Yet, for some reason, this information is covered in detail in the news or by the U.S. government.
      This video on the evolution of PMC's shows how they have played a larger and larger role in conflicts on the global scale. I not would be surprised if PMC's disrupt government militaries in the future by not only performing better, but working more efficiently without a large bureaucracy.
      While the concept may be troubling, I think it's only a matter of time for PMC's to do to the military what Space X has begun to do to NASA and ROSCOSMOS.

      This is a hard, time consuming read that is dense with ideas. The book introduces us to System 1 and System 2 which are the two systems that govern how how thinking and brain power is allocated.
      These two systems are used as the basis of explaining many of the insufficiencies of the human mind. Topics such as the limitations of intuition, inability to maximize utility, and the superseding of rational thought by emotional reactions are covered.
      While the book may read like a textbook, it is very thought provoking. The implications extend to all aspects of our society and may explain why certain policies are favored in government, why one interview candidate was chosen over the other, even if the other choice is objectively better than what was ultimately chosen.

      Given the time this film was made, the director definitely had the choice of using color, but chose to use black and white. I feel that this was the correct decision.

      A series of interconnected stories about different people stuggling with different psychological disorders and mental illnesses with the only constant being Dr. Irabu the psychiatrist.
      The show uses a combination of different animation techniques such as rotoscoping and live action to better show many of the abstract thoughts the creators wished to convey and to better educate about the disorders including the outlining of any artistic licenses that have been taken.
      The experimental approach to the topics covered is growing more rare in the animation industry in Japan, but the care given to the work reinforces the case for greater risks to be taken in animation.
      Because many of the cases are specific to Japan, the show also manages to touch upon the collective unconcious of the country. I think Carl Jung would be proud.

      Also watched the game which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/cUTMhmVh1qs" target="_blank">here</a>.
      I felt like I had deja vu watching this, because, like the Lee Sedol vs Alphago games, I did not have a full understanding of the rules of the games.
      That said, it was exciting to watch just like the alphago games. This time, Deepmind set their sights on Starcraft II.
      What I found interesting about the AI was that it did not have as high of an APM as the pro players. It seemed to deliberately choose its actions.
      This most likely indicates that the pro players have many redundant actions.
      My guess is that the AI noticed patterns within the game that humans have overlooked.

      It's a sin to kill a mockingbird. I have never read this novel before, and after reading it, I can understand why it is part of many high school curriculums.
      While, many focus on its coverage of the treatment of African Americans during the depression era, the novel is a coming of age story at its heart that shows how nonsensical the world can be through a child's eyes.
      I found many of the characters to be convincing and well thought out. This was particularly the case with Atticus Finch who is shown to be a rare example of a principled man in a town with racist tendencies.
      I intend to watch the film in the near future.

      A highly educational series about the workings of the body that is very much in the vein of works such as Fantastic Voyage and Osmosis Jones.

      The series covers topics such as allergic reactions, food poisoning, and other inner body events that require an immune response.
      In terms of narrative, it is not the strongest, but within its genre, it is probably one of the best and makes what is usually a dry topic very interesting.

      The film adds to the source material with clever writing, great stop motion animation, and many of the quirks Wes Anderson is famous for.
      The voice acting by George Clooney and Meryl Streep suited the characters very well and added traits to the characters that was not described in the book.

      This is the first time I've viewed any of Osamu Hayashi's work. Japan has a constant focus on work, and the debt one owes society.
      However, in many cases, this can remove meaning from one's existence within society.
      Here, Hayashi Sensei discusses with many Neets who have performed well academically what it means to have a job, and why it is unreasonable to always expect for society to conform to your wishes.
      He also explores the topics within the context of his own life experiences and clearly outlines the differences between what one wants to do in life and what what can do in life.
      The conversation is nuanced and touches upon many different subjects and offers meaning to aspects of life that are usually never explored in depth in Japanese society.

      Siddhartha is written in a lyrical style and reads very similarly to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.

      The book is split into two parts. The first covers Viktor Frankl's time in the German concentration camps and the second covers logotherapy.
      The usage of Viktor Frankl's experience during the Holocaust to explain the significance of meaning was very powerful.
      I found logotherapy to be a more rational approach to psychotherapy and finding meaning to life than other approaches, but it does seem dated.
      A more modern approach might utilize statistics and mathematics to clearly outline patterns in human behavior.

      I also recommend watching his talks with Joe Rogan and his recent appearance on Impact Theory.
      Using hypoxia to improve mental and bodily tolerances is something that I have never tried before, and the amount of added control it provides to the body makes it seem like a very valuable skill that is very similar to that which is exhibited by Shaolin monks.
      Wim Hof's insistence on taking rigorous metrics and scientifically analyzing everything has expelled any doubts that his technique can allow for the human body to overcome various limits.

      This was not an easy book to read due to my ignorance about Russian culture and history.
      That said, the plight of Raskolnikov was not only relatable, but it can be observed in one form or another in the lives of people today.
      Because of this, the philosophical underpinnings were not lost in translation or lost to time.
      The organization of the book may seem strange to some, because it switches its focus to its side characters frequently.
      While this may be interpretted as a flaw in the novel, the treatment of the Marmeladovs and Svidrigailov gives us a more complete study of human behavior that may not be exhibited by Raskolnikov.
      Dostoyevsky added an epilogue at the end. This, in my opinion, weakened the ending, and I recommend thoroughly skipping it.

      A fun film that offers a glimpse into the future where automation, robotics, and neural interfaces are beginning to become more ubiquitous.
      While the movie is not great, it is good. The story is thought provoking, the choreography was well organized, and it is entertaining from beginning to end.
      If you have an hour and a half to spend, this film is a good way to spend it.

  explanation: >
      This book went by quickly not only because it was short, but also because it was well written.
      It provides in concrete terms the types of workouts David Goggins undergoes as well as an intro into the type of person Jesse Itzler is.
      The book offers a clear representation of the numbers that need to be reached and the attitude with which to approach tough problems to reach the level David Goggins operates at.
      I intend to incrementally work my way up to some of the numbers in this book and hopefully surpass them in the future.

      I was in absolute awe of the animation style the entire duration of the film.
      The boundaries between 2d and 3d are seamlessly intertwined.
      The hip hop soundtrack was much appreciated.
      As someone who read many of the Spiderverse comics, I found this to be thoroughly enjoyable, and to have a great story.
      Even if you aren't a fan of the source material, I feel that there is a lesson for everyone to take away from this movie.
      Although this is missing characters like Silk, Anya, and Jessica Drew, I think their exclusion worked to the benefit of the film by preventing things from getting too complicated.
      If the end credits is anything to go by, we'll have a sequel and I am looking forward to it.

      A trilogy of three interconnected stories that take place in Essex County in Ontario, Canada.
      The stories are simple, somewhat surreal, and take place in different times.

  explanation: >
      My first Walter Isaacson biography. It covers Benjamin Franklin's life from beginning to end.
      I found that I learned quite a bit about colonial and post independence America that I did not learn in grade school.
      In school, our knowledge tends to be very America specific, so global events, France's involvement and Canada are covered in very little detail if any.
      I also found the tips and tricks that Benjamin Franklin developped in regards to work to be very useful. Overall, I learned that Franklin's achievements extend past his actions during America's Revolutionary war.
      Not only was he a politician, but he was a scientist, a printer, and a well rounded person who influenced many things we take for granted today.

  explanation: >
      Watched the livestream on Dec 18 as well. You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/nSIzsMlwMUY" target="_blank">here</a>. The test tunnel is very proof of concept.
      The electric skates in the simulation are gone and replaced with a set of wheels that are attached to a Tesla.
      The tunnel itself was disappointing, but the highlight of the show is the many-fold gains made in tunneling and boring technology.
      I'm hoping that the actual tunnels are a far more refined and practical.

  explanation: >
      It seems like there are a lot of things happening even as we are finishing up the year.
      VSS Unity went past what the United States Air Force defines as the Kármán line. With this success, I am hoping the we can get more sophisticated aeronautics in the mainstream.
      I am hoping that we'll not only be using this for tourism, but also for high speed air travel in the future in a way that is similar to Space X's BFR Earth to Earth plan.
      I was hoping for a live stream, but this video had some great footage.

  explanation: >
      A somewhat sad film that brought back a few bad memories while I was watching it. That said, it is short and simple.
      It does not dwell on topics, but it also does not shy away from the troubles faced by many of the children in the foster home.
      The stop motion animation is clean and vibrant. I recommend it not only for children, but for adults as well. There is something here for everyone.
      If you don't have a lot of time, this is a great short movie to watch.

  explanation: >
      It seems like many of the works I've been consuming lately deals with life and death. Daytripper is a work that has a unique device where the main character dies at the end of each issue during different points in his life.
      Daytripper not only discusses the important life changing moments that can result in the rebirth of one's identity, but also the fact that everyone will die. In many cases, it treads similar ground as Siddhartha Gautama, but it offers a more personal and modern touch that may make it easier to relate to.

  explanation: >
      I think this is the first Swedish film I have ever seen. Although this film is not fast paced, it does not drag on and moves from scene to scene with purpose.
      Themes of Death and God are tackled in this film and are handled very well. Even though it is in black and white, images have staying power and are carefully thought out.
      In many ways, it makes me feel like it is an older version of Death Parade and may actually be one of the sources of inspiration that Death Parade drew from.

  explanation: >
      This video from VICE begins with a demonstration of what a malicious attacker is capable of when they take advantage of vulnerabilities in a self driving car.
      We live in a time where cybersecurity is growing in importance. Israel and it's military and private institutions are growing and attaining global dominance in these areas.
      Usually, we think of the U.S., Russia, China, and the U.K.'s GCHQ as the giants in the security arena. Now, it must be acknowledged that Israel is a powerful force in intelligence and cyber warfare.
      Recently, we've seen glimpses of Israel's power in Snowden's files, and Harvey Weinsteins' hiring of Black Cube. With the growth of private companies in Israel, I expect the frequency of Israeli firms in the news to only increase.

  explanation: >
      A soft introduction into deep learning in the context of self driving cars. This is a class that is led by Lex Fridman. I found this to be highly interesting.
      It includes talks by people in the industry and not only covers the technical aspects of the field, but also how policy and business is changing to accomodate the changes.
      Also includes a very simple example that helped me better understand how gradient descent and backpropogation works. You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/nFTQ7kHQWtc?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

  explanation: >
      A film that I was told should be required viewing for any office worker. It wasn't as funny as I expected it to be, but I enjoyed it all the same. I found that it did not connect as well because it takes place in the late 90's. That could just be the effect of a generational gap.
      That said, I think most people who have worked white collar jobs will find something in here that they will like. I'm honestly quite surprised that the critical response is not higher.

  explanation: >
      A book that covers the Nanking Massacre in great detail. The novel is split into three parts that details the event from the perspective of the Chinese, the Japanese, and foreigners that were in Nanking during the time.
      The contents of this book were heavy, and the descriptions of many of the war crimes that occured were difficult to stomach. Iris Chang wrote a compelling book, and it is unfortunate that she committed suicide. This book is not easy reading, but I feel that it is something that should be read so that we never forget what occurred.

  explanation: >
      Available on Gutenberg. This is a translation of the Lao Tzu's work. The Tao or the Dao is often contradictory and this is to be expected because of the inherent nature of yin and yang in the Taiji.
      In many cases, the teachings seem like common sense, but in some, the messages can seem cryptic or often unintuitive. For those who are unfamiliar with eastern philosophy, this can be difficult to conceptually grasp.
      One thing that I found interesting was that I could see some of concepts that would later show up in Confucianism. Concepts such as humility which are very common in east Asian cultures can be found here.

      12 rules for making more sense of the world. This was intended to be a more accessible version of Maps of Meaning, but I found that this read less like a helpful guide and more like a series of essays. References to the Bible were thorough and used to explain points, but I found them to detract from the lessons being covered.
      The book is well written, but overly long. My impression of the book is mixed. I recommend listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures instead.

      A film that may not appeal to everyone. It's a slow moving, but stylistic and beautiful film. Shots are well constructed and thoughtfully paced. It's scarce on plot, but high on artistry.

  explanation: >
      A work of art that I believe should deserve more attention. There are not many works that cover topics such as heaven and hell as well as life and death. The emphasis on the void and reincarnation diverges from the traditional themes of good and evil that can be found in monotheistic religion.
      As a result, a more nuanced interpretation of the topics is provided in the show. This is a show that I believe can appeal to a critic's sensibility as well as to the mainstream. Every detail seems purposeful and well thought out.
      In my opinion, this is the best anime I've seen so far this year.

      After 14 years, Red Bull BC One returns to Switzerland. I found this world final to be easier to digest compared to last year's world final.
      Although the judging seemed questionable, it was still an enjoyable experience. Lil Zoo is a skilled bboy with tenure. The inclusion of the bgirl world final was also appreciated.

      Reading this was a chore. I read Walden due to references made to it in Shane Carruth's Upstream Color. I found that it was redundant and many times contradictory. That said, it was impressive how many different ways Henry David Thoreau was able to state his appreciation of nature and the outdoors.

  explanation: >
      The first season was what got me started with my current routine of waking up at 4:30 and going to the gym. So, I have a bit of attachment to this series.
      The second season is just as good in my opinion. Because it is a shounen anime, the concept of incremental progress is baked right into the themes driving the show.
      This Japanese take on the superhero genre is unique and it has heart.

  explanation: >
      I played through the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection in Japanese, Ground Zeros on PS4 and The Phantom Pain on ps3.
      Because of that, I thought it would be strange for me to play this last. Despite this, I found MGS to be one of the best in the series and thoroughly enjoyable despite its age.
      The care given to Sniper Wolf made her one of my most favorite characters in the series. Although I played the integral version, I think the game should play well on any console because of the simple controls.
      This is a cinematic game that I think anyone will be able to enjoy.

      Multivariable Calculus for Khan Academy. Covers topics such as partial derivatives, gradients, curl, divergence, triple integrals, line integrals, etc.
      Not all of the content has been committed to long term memory, but important concepts like a partial and a gradient have stuck. One thing I underestimated was how much of a time suck this would be. Each video is about 10-15 minutes.
      After this, I'll probably move onto linear algebra, or physics.

      Scalable and accurate simulation of light within a virtual environment. If the technology continues at the same pace, we'll hopefully have photorealistic computer graphics in films within 5 years and the same for video games within 10-15 years.
      This will allow for the immersive nature of VR and AR to increase tremendously. Now, all we need are sophisticated haptic feedback systems or neural links to allow for better interaction with the virtual environments.
      That said, I would have liked to have seen some info about graphics cards for consumers.

      This was recommended to me by the instructor of a creative writing course that I took while I was in university. I put off watching this for a while, and I regret doing so. Brie Larson was great, but the star of the film was Jacob Tremblay. His performance was probably the best I've ever seen out of a child actor.

      I went into this film expecting a post apocalyptic wasteland and came out of it somewhat disappointed. The movie feels dated, and because it is the first film, it doesn't seem to have the apocalyptic landscape that was present in Fury Road.

      I can see why this is considered one of the best first person shooters ever made.
      The story mode has a good difficulty progression. The music is memorable, and Master Chief is a great protagonist.
      For a game that is over 17 years old, it does not feel old at all.

      I played the gamecube version of this on the dolphin emulator with a 3rd party xbox controller formatted like a ps4 controller.
      It is easy to tell why this is one of the greatest games ever made.
      In addition to bringing the Zelda franchise into the 3rd dimension, this game boasts great level design, and finely tuned controls.
      The music is iconic, and the characters are memorable. This game has aged well.
      It appeals to players of all ages and backgrounds, and has something to offer to anyone who picks up the controller and gives it a go.
      The playtime is over 30 hours, so you won't need to worry about it ending too soon.

  explanation: >
      In this sequel, the budget is higher and the jokes are more expensive. Deadpool is no longer something new, so it is interesting to see how they try to keep him fresh.
      In terms of the script, the quality is about the same as first, but there are times when it drags. If it was shortened slightly, it would be a tight film.

      Watched in Imax. A film that is the culmination of three phases of films in the Marvel cinematic universe.
      Although it may be lacking in story, it more than makes up for it with its scale and the ambitious plot that brings together all of the characters in the marvel universe.
      In addition to this, it finally brings Thanos to the forefront and provides him with greater depth than he had in the comics. I saw the first Avengers film when I was in high school, so the payoff was particularly rewarding to me.

      One of the most memorable events of the year. I never thought the rocket would successfully take off. The climax was the simultaneous landing of the side boosters.
      It would have been nice to see the center core land on the droneship, but 2/3 is still great. The shot of starman floating off into space was a good touch.
      Space x's have been continuously getting better over the years and this launch proved that they could not only nail the launch, but the telemetry as well.

      Saw this in imax. Great film. Although this was not my favorite Nolan film, it easily is one of the most well made among his works.
      The shots of the fighter planes were the most technical and impressive scenes in the film. Hans Zimmer's usage of the Shepard's tone could have been more emphasized.
      I actually did not realize that a Shepard's tone was used until looking it up after the fact. Because of how drawn out the auditory illusion was, in many cases, it felt as if the effect of the illusion was diminished.

      Saw this in imax. An underrated film; just as great as the first. Probably the best experience I've had watching a film in a movie theatre. The custom Imax intro was a nice touch.
