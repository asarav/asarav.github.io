    This is the second game developed by Fullbright after Gone Home.
    Like Gone Home, this is an exploration style game that is short in duration.
    This time, the story takes place on an orbital station, and involves piecing together events that happened using an AI interface.
    The general design of the station and story are well done, but the short duration seemed to lessen the impact of any reveals.
    Finally, the idea of retrieving AI data through an AR interface does not make much sense.

    This is the first film I saw with Amitabh Bachchan and the first film I saw that used Hindustani instead of just Hindi as its language.
    This is a fairly solid movie, but much of its appeal was lost on me.
    The reason for this is because it seemed to copy from westerns like Magnificent Seven, and Once Upon a Time in the West without improving upon those films in a significant way.
    While those films had signature soundtracks and camera work, this film seemed to be a bit lacking and simplistic in comparison.
    One thing to note is that the restored HD version has a few gimmicks that were intended to be used for 3D viewing, and it is noticeable in that it seems to distract from the actual contents of the film-- whenever there is an explosion, it is pretty much always guaranteed that there is some cgi object flying out towards the camera. 
    That said, I do have a similar reaction when I see Star Wars films nowadays, so it's not too surprising that I wasn't all that caught up with the style of this film that is so clearly designed for mass appeal.

  explanation: >
    Played using PCSX2 without upscaling with the software renderer.
    This is supposedly the best that the Ace Combat series has to offer, and while it is a great game, it is very much a product of its time and a remaster or remake would be very much appreciated.
    There are no drones, the planes are older models, and the graphics are representative of early PS2 graphics complete with dithering.
    Consequently, there is a limited simulation of atmospheric conditions with no condensation, icing or wind taken into account.
    That said, the story is grounded, the concept of anti-asteroid railgun system known as Stonehenge was innovative, and the fictional universe known as Strangereal felt very much like our own.
    The ability to hear the radio chatter of both allies and the enemy makes for a very immersive experience and is probably one of its largest strengths.
    The dogfights were intense and enemies use techniques that are common in dogfighting even today.
    The missions made sense in the context of a larger military conflict and the way in which you play an active role and affect the flow of battle is very well done.
    This is not an easy game. There is a learning curve, but once an understanding of missile systems and dogfighting techniques is reached, it pays off.

    A continuation of Half Life 2.
    There are no new mechanics introduced, so it's really more of the same.
    This is not necessarily a negative, but one thing to note is that the huge changes scene between Half Life 1 and Half Life 2 are not seen here.
    We see the return of the gravity gun, but we don't see Gordon Freeman's signaturue crowbar until the middle of the game.
    Alyx as an AI controlled partner was surprisingly tolerable.

    This is Al Pacino at his best, and I would consider this role to be one of his most defining.
    This is a story where Al Pacino plays a retired blind army colonel with a unique personality.

    This is like a Hong Kong version of The Intouchables without the music.
    More emphasis is placed on the shots and color grading, and the story, while not particularly ground breaking, depicts a story of a caretaker's relationship with her boss.
    This brings attention to Filipina maids and the troubles they go through, and the shots of apartment complexes in Hong Kong are stunning.

    This has received quite a bit of critical praise, but I feel like what was great about it as lost on me.
    Scenes tend to be rich and oppulent, and Shah Rukh Khan plays an NRI returning home like he does in pretty much most of his films.
    The plot is unimpressive. It has elements that can be found in Sophoclean or Shakesperean plays, but the way in which events lead to other events seem hamfisted at best.
    Motivations for characters are underdevelopped, and the flowery language and interesting shots can't really save it in my eyes.

    This is rough around the edges, but it was made by mostly one person, so that can be forgiven.
    The art is not that great, and the voice acting is cheesy.
    This can work because it is partly satirical, but it's hard to tell when to take the content matter seriously.
    That said, this is a very detailed work with a lot of thought put into it although the writing does seem amateurish at times.
    From a sci-fi perspective, this is probably the only work that gets as into the details as books I've read in the genre by William Gibson or Neal Stephenson.
    This makes it very impressive because it is difficult to get across that level of detail in a game.
    The music is very reminiscent of Blade Runner, but it isn't a cheap immitation and uses elements like dialup tones, static, and gunshots to add texture.
    In addition to this, this manages to move genre tropes forward by introducing concepts like unilaterally assured destruction as an evolution of mutually assured destruction or weaponizin parallel timelines.
    This makes this a very unique game, and I don't think I've seen anything like it even when I compare it with other cyberpunk games.

    Covers mental deficiencies like dyslexia and how it can go untreated within the Indian education system.
    An interesting thing I noticed is how Indian education seems to be leaning towards processing a large number of students as quickly as possible like a factory.
    Unfortunately, it seems like this is the trend for education at all levels in many parts of the world due to increasing population, so it is questionable whether students who have certain deficiencies will receive the specialized care that they need.
    All things said, this was an informative film with good shots caught in frame, and shows that Amir Khan is a good director, producer, actor and one of the more versatile individuals in Bollywood.

    This is a movie that operates with its own logic and is so Indian in its identity that I felt like I could smell spice while watching it.
    SRK's character is openly wears his feelings, and the way people act in this film make it seem more like something out of a Disney movie.
    Cinematography and overall direction make it seem more like a classic film from the 70's or 80's rather than something out the 90's, and the different locations used make it hard to tell when the movie takes place.
    The mix of Hindi and English along with many words and phrases being repeated throughout actually make it a nice way to learn some Hindi phrases.

    This movie is to Mani Ratnam what The Aviator was to Martin Scorsese, and solidifies my impression of Mani Ratnam as India's Martin Scorsese.
    This film is not Mani Ratnam's best, but the depiction of a developing India and Turkey was very interesting to see.
    This film has a certain intense momentum in parts of the story that can suck you in, and it would have been nice if the story was written to emphasize those parts.
    Abhishek Bachchan's performance as the businessman Gurukant Desai was intense and just great, making him the centerpiece of the film.
    Other than Madhavan, who managed to hold his own, other actors were either good or just adequate in comparson.
    The score by A.R. Rahman was great, but the individual songs were good but unimpressive compared to his more memorable works.
    Editing lacked subtlety and is probably the weakest part of the film due to it being more flashy than it needed to be.
    Apparently this was based on the life of Dhirubhai Ambani which I did not know about beforehand.

    This is like Roja without the political backdrop.
    When compared to Dil Se, this is the opposite in that it has clearly good writing, acting, but a smaller budget and scale.
    In this film, the cinematography is conducted by P. C. Sriram instead of Santosh Sivan and as a result, there are some clear differences in the shots.
    With regards to Mani Ratnam's previous work, the director innovates this time by using an anachronistic structure which is not often used in films in general.
    In addition to this, this offers a realistic depiction of married life.
    While I prefer Mani Ratnam's works that feature a larger scale, this is a good film with decent cinematography and features some memorable tracks by A.R. Rahman.

    This is one of the highest rated Indian films in Imdb.

    I think the plot was not all that ground breaking, but despite that, this executes well on all aspects.

    The music is great, the cinematography is great, the acting and script are debatable.
    The main character would be categorized as a stalker by today's standards.
    In older Islamic stories, this type of behavior may be considered normal, but when you place such as story in a modern setting, it becomes a conflicting point.
    This is what prevents this from being a great film in my opinion.
    Acting also seems to be overdone by SRK and the melodrama seems to have removed any subtlety from the picture.
    That said, for Mani Ratnam's first Hindi film, this is a good achievement, and the film seems very modern in terms of technical achievements.
    In terms of songs, I think this also one of AR Rahman's best works.
    This film also covers the topic of liberationists which many in the west may not know about India.
    While it may not be a perfect film, it has iconic moments, and is worth watching despite the long runtime.

    This is a road trip style comedy drama that has good cinematography.
    Out of all the Indian films I have seen so far, this is the least Indian film I have seen.
    The film takes place in Spain, the music breaks are not as abrupt as other films, and the general style seems very western.
    It presents philosophies about life through experiences on the trip and does a lot of "show don't tell".
    The way scenes of diving, skydiving and Encierro were filmed puts you in the moment.
    That said, the skydiving was somewhat unrealistic, because free fall does not last as long as they show in the film.

    This is the first film that A.R. Rahman scored and you can tell because of the heavy use of synths.
    Roja is a very different film from Nayakan in terms of story despite both being directed by Mani Ratnam.
    This film borrows from the Mahabharatha making it a very strange film in terms of how its story plays out due to it not using completely modern conventions in its story telling.
    Cinematography is as good if not better than Nayakan.
    One thing that seems fairly obvious is that Mani Ratnam is not used to filming action and stuntwork seems amateurish.
    The political backdrop is one of the strengths of this film, and offers some context that grounds the older origins of the story in modern times.
    Overall, this is a good film that showcases Mani Ratnam's unique style.
    One thing to note is that English subtitles are mostly accurate, but do not appear to be direct translations, so some level of nuance is lost in the translation process.

    Despite this having some cliches, this is a very novel and original story.
    Like many Indian films, this is a long one and comes complete with an intermission.
    I doubt that most people watch it through in one sitting.
    It is also a good way to get introduced to the rules and convensions of cricket.
    I don't think I've seen a movie about cricket and I don't think I've seen a good historical sports film that did not involve boxing or running.
    The mixture of Hindi and English make this accessible to a western audience despite some of the music breaks, which are less abrupt compared to other films.
    The classic story of an underdog is well done and characters are unique which helps the unique setting of the story.
    Acting is good, and cinematography is occasionally great, but usually mediocre.
    The setup is flawed, but the actual cricket match towards the end is very entertaining.

    One of my goals when I learn Mandarin is to be able to quote the Analects from memory.
    This is a good initial step towards that goal, but it also allows for a deeper understanding of east Asian culture.
    This holds many similarities to some of Plato's works and some of the Greek works that were written during the same time.
    There are conversations between characters and anecdotes about certain characters as examples of certain principles that are emphasized in The Analects.
    The majority of this book is about this character (usually Confucius) saying a certain thing or another character saying something else.
    Filial piety, propriety, the branches of learning, the mandate of heaven, and other concepts that were tested within the imperial examination in ancient China are all here.
    There are many things here that, by modern standards, will seem sexist or contradictory.

    Space X beat ULA to the ISS and successfully managed to dock. This is the first time humans were aboard a privately developed rocket.
    Overall, the mission went smoothly, but it is not over until Crew Dragon is able to successfully land on earth.
    With this, maybe a larger amount of focus can be directed towards Starship.

    This is a good, but imperfect movie. Camerawork is way more shaky than is necessary.
    The Apollo mission was pretty accurate. It matched what I saw in archival footage.
    Although not historically accurate in every sense, it manages to tell a good story by dramatizing parts of Neil Armstrong's life despite his life already being somewhat dramatic.
    There are some good shots in here, but this is not Damien Chazelle's best work and it did seem like he was out of his element working in a non-music related film.

    An interesting take on internet browsing from the 90's with a twist where the users are browsing the internet while they are sleeping through some sort of dream based interface.
    The operating system of HypnOS mimics Windows 95.
    While this can get frustrating at times, the experience feels very faithful to the experience of using a computer in the 90's from dated references to general user experience.
    The developers manage to tell a story through the clunky interace and also show how the internet changes over the years.

  explanation: >
    I thought the series ended with the second movie, but then they made a third one and then a fourth one.
    The third one felt like a decent conclusion, but this fourth did not feel like that at all.
    Donnie Yen was good as always and Scott Adkins did well as the antagonist.
    As is typical in these types of movies, foreign influences act as an oppressor of Chinese endeavors.
    The writing felt weak in this one, but the technical quality is consistent with previous films.
    Choreography is good, cinematography is decent and Kenji Kawaii's score is good as always.
    Although the Ip Man series has a lot of fictional events, this one is the least historically accurate and it shows.

    This is included in Time's all-time 100 best films.
    Overall, this is a film with great cinematography and acting.
    The cinematography in particular is well thought out, and it plays like something from the 70's despite it being filmed in the 80's.
    For a gangster film, this is also fairly unique not only in terms of the setting, but it also provides questions of morality which is somewhat uncommon since gangster films usually don't argue about the moral incompetencies of their main character.

    The five attitudes are also explained.
    I personally struggle to understand how this can be applied outside of martial arts.
    There are words of advice that are useful elsewhere-- particularly philosophies regarding martial arts and strategy--, but when you get into the details, it becomes harder to abstract literal sword positions and apply them to other domains.

    I think this is the first non-Chinese and non-American martial arts biopic I've seen.
    Like most martial arts films, the story is not perfect, but the choreography is quite impressive.
    I think this is one of the few times I've seen Karate presented as a full contact martial arts, so punches and movements don't have clean lines like you may see in a typical form.
    In addition to that, I think this is the first film I've seen that covers the perspective of Zainichi Koreans.
    Choreography is brutal, and I think people were hit with full force during the fight scenes which is not very common.

    I came away from this very impressed.
    The story felt like it was written by someone who had a background in computer science or at least in the tech industry.
    Terms regarding semantics and natural language processing were used correctly, and discussions of AI did not come across as overly optimistic.
    The concept of online counseling as a way to accumulate a corpus that can be used to train a general intelligence is original despite the concept of online counseling not being an economically scaleable business in the form that was presented in the game.
    There is also some coverage of the debates regarding psychology and psychotherapy as a rigorous field of study.
    I felt somewhat disappointed with the way the endings were handled, but despite that, I found this to be a realistic treatment of technology and the different motivations behind it.

    It has been years since I last saw a good zombie movie, so Train to Busan to me felt reinvigorating for the genre.
    The cinematography was excellent and the story was not predictable at all.
    You felt what the characters felt and it was very visceral.
    This is a movie that keeps giving and giving.
    The behavior of zombies can be inconsistent at times, but other than that, this is a tight film that knows what it is doing.
    Overall, a thrilling film from start to finish that has a few flaws that are easy to overlook.
    Great to watch during a pandemic.

  explanation: >
    Like all Final Fantasy games, this is quite a time investment.
    In terms of how this compares to other games, this is probably the best executed, but also the safest game.
    What I mean by safe is that there is nothing particularly groundbreaking here.
    It does what has already been done in previous games in the series, but better.
    It is for this reason that I actually prefer FFVII over this.
    In terms of graphics, this improves upon FFVII. Characters no longer look blocky, and FMV's look like something out of a painting.
    This game has actually aged quite well.
    Conversely, the music is not as great as other games. That is not to say that the music is bad, but I found it lacking for a Final Fantasy game despite a great main theme.
    Battle mechanics are also fairly standard.
    Finally, the world feels less fleshed out and smaller compared to other entries.
    Despite this, I felt that the story was on par with less ambitious entries despite it not being quite that detailed due to the main characters.
    All things said, this was probably my least favorite out of all the Final Fantasy games I have played up to this point, but when I heard the main Final Fantasy theme come on during the end credits like the Disney theme comes on at the beginning of a Disney film, I felt fairly satisfied.

  explanation: >
    This was way better than I was expecting it to be and I was pleasantly surprised.
    Writing is mature and dialogue is smooth.
    Action and animation is simplistic compared to the state of the art during the time, but the images and backgrounds compensate.
    The city of Gotham looks like something that came out of the 1940's, and this adds to the atmosphere.
    While watching this, I could not help but compare this to black and white noir films from the late 30's and 40's which reflects the high quality of the work.
    Overall, this is a solid Batman film that thoroughly explores the motivations of its main character.

  explanation: >
    While the contents of this book may be considered novel from a western standpoint, it uses a lot of common tropes that show up in Chinese webnovels.
    This is a book that takes place in an alternate reality where certain events haven't occured.
    This allows for the main character of Zhang Ye to introduce popular books and shows from the original reality to become famous.
    In addition to this, the book uses a system mechanic that shows up in other Chinese novels to add to the the novelty of the story.
    In many ways, this is a book about wish fulfillment.
    The main character becomes a jack of all trades that stands at the top of China all because he has knowledge from the original reality and a system that gives him game-like bonuses.
    This can get old quickly, but it is very satisfying if you are willing to suspend disbelief.
    In my opinion, the biggest strength of this novel is its thorough overview of Chinese culture.
    This novel covers famous books and movies and people that have been influential in China while also covering what foreign works have been of greatest influence in the domestic market.
    There is also a decent coverage of differing cultures across the different provinces of China.
    While it may not be worth reading all 1600+ chapters that were written before it was discontinued, I would say that the first 600 chapters are entertaining.

  explanation: >
    This film is considered iconic among Cantonese films, and while it has its moments, it is also imperfect.
    Part of this is culturual.
    There are abrupt shifts from comedy to serious moments, and a western audience will most likely view this as a weakness despite it being rather common within Hong Kong films.
    I feel that if it focused more on the gambling and action and less on the comedy, it might have functioned better.
    The beginning and the end are great, but the middle is not in my opinion, and the usage of a head injury as a cause of amnesia is somewhat cliche.
    It is not a bad film, but it is on the border between an average film and a good one.

    Although this is inferior to Steins;Gate, but is still a good series.
    This series builds upon the events of Steins;Gate by analyzing an alternate world line that did not have the same ending in Steins;Gate.
    In this timeline, World War III will still happen, and the gimick of AI is presented as a way for people to achieve some form of immortality.
    The strengths of this series lies in its abilities to take the mechanics introduced in Steins;Gate and expand upon them to flesh out the futures and pasts that were hinted at in Steins;Gate.
    Overall, it does not do anything particularly new when compared to the original Steins;Gate, but it manages to use time travel to tell a compelling story that drags at the beginning, but picks up later on.

    I consider the second part to be better than the first because part two seems to play to the strengths of the source material, and build off of the events in part one.
    We finally see the appearance familiar characters such as Monkey and Pig, and a reasonable conclusion to the story.
    The fight between the Monkey King and Bull Demon King was well done.
    With more modern works, typically CGI would be used for the more nonsensical aspects of Journey to the West, but this film uses practical effects which I felt added to the quality.
    Overall, I found it to be creative and thought it was one of the few films that manages to successfully mix tragedy and comedy.

    This is a film that is directed by Jeffrey Lau, but it stars Stephen Chow.
    This film, like many Stephen Chow films, brings in Man-Tat Ng to add Mo Lei Tau style comedy to the story.
    A Chinese Odyssey is based on Journey to the West, but this is a reimagining of the story from the perspective of the Monkey King rather than a retelling of the Ming dynasty classic.
    Some of the comedy and plot will not make sense if you don't have some familiarity with Journey to the West and Chinese culture beforehand.
    This film drags at the beginning, but improves towards the end.
    Overall, it is a good film, but execution is not the best.
    Acting and comedy is fine, but pacing and special effects do seem a little bit lacking from a western perspective.

    Network was a film made during a time when CNN, MSNBC, FOX, and televangelism were not available.
    It not only covers the conflict all news faces when trying to inform and entertain, but also has larger messages about the country and state of the world.
    Although the film focuses on television, the general messages apply, perhaps even more so, to how people consume information today.
    While I was not a fan of the cinematography, the story is tight and well scripted.
    Acting by Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch was top notch.
    Like 12 Angry Men, this Sidney Lumet film is engaging.

    This is a great example of Stephen Chow's talents and Hong Kong's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_lei_tau" target="_blank">Mo Lei Tau</a> style of comedy.
    When watching this, it is clear why Jackie Chan broke through to the international stage while Stephen Chow did not.
    Jackie Chan is a martial artist that dabbles in comedy while Stephen Chow is a comedian that dabbles in martial arts.
    Because of this, the word play and cultural references in Stephen Chow's works don't translate as well.
    That said, if you are familiar with Hong Kong culture and Chinese scholarship in general, you will find that this is a smartly written film that has something for the literate as well as the common people.
    There is a nice mixture of classical poetry, Chinese opera tropes with modern references that I've never seen in western cinema and was very rare in mainland Chinese films during the time.
    If you are looking to understand Cantonese a little better or just have an interest in historical Chinese figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Yin" target="_blank">Tong Pak Fu</a> this will satisfy your needs.

    The most mentally challenging game that I ever played.
    The puzzles were difficult and were challenging despite the commonality of drawing lines.
    The philosophy and message of the game flew over my head in a way that I've only see happen in Shane Carruth films.
    For many, this can be hit or miss due to the lack of a narrative and the difficulty and abundance of puzzles.
    Despite this, I found the imagery, use of Feng Shui and Zen Buddhist ideas in combination with western philosophy and poetry to be very original.
    This is not a game that you speed through. This is a game that takes months to complete with frequent breaks away from the screen.
    While some of the puzzles can be brute forced, it is recomended that you focus more on pattern recognition unless you are an extremely patient person.

    I don't remember the last time I saw a Bollywood film if ever.
    There was also a lot more English in this film than I was expecting which was a surprise.
    This is a film that I think will appeal almost universally to the general audience and be received a little bit more mildly although positively by film critics.
    One thing to note is that since it is a Bollywood film, it is very long, people will teleport to random places and start singing, and there will be instances of somewhat overacted melodrama.
    That said, the main themes of the film such as friendship, purpose and education along with its humor and wit allow for it to be easily relatable.
    There are many things that I did find to be rather fascinating from a cultural perspective.
    I did not realize engineers were a big deal in India, and I did not realize that instructors had as much authority as they did in educational institutions.
    The closest thing I can think of to this is attitudes towards education in mainland China.

    The noir style story of drugs developped by the military to slow down and replay time was very interesting and would have worked well in a comic or film.

  explanation: >
    The initial premise was similar to a short story I wrote years ago except my story was from the perspective of the supervisors and not the natives of the planet.
    Childhood's End is a different take on the first contact story where the aliens have a special plan for humanity and help humanity despite not revealing their intentions.
    It is one part science fiction and one part mystery where the reader is learning of how humanity society can be improved into something more utopian while at the same time losing certain freedoms.
    The third act is probably the best part of the book despite its abstractness.
    Concepts regarding cosmic level intelligences and the evolution of life into something more formless draws from not only Greek philosophy, but also gave similar impressions as what one may experience when reading H.P. Lovecraft.
    Overall, this is an entertaining read.
    The only large complaint I might have is one that I have with other Western science fiction which is that characters seem to only be instruments to move plot forward.
    This was apparently a three part mini-series on the Syfy channel.

    I remember watching Stalker many years ago and falling asleep in the middle of it (I still liked the movie though).
    Unlike Stalker, Roadside Picnic seemed easier to follow and denser in content despite lacking some of the philosophy that Andrei Tarkovsky was known for.
    Also, in Roadside Picnic, they actually explain what caused the creation of the zone.
    In Stalker, I was convinced that it had something to do with nuclear power, but in Roadside Picnic, it was clarified that the cause was aliens.
    The concept of the zone as a sort of Bermuda triangle on land is highly original.
    This is a short read, but it has interesting ideas. I'd like to play the games that were based off of this next if I have the time.

  explanation: >
    I don't play a lot of flash games nowadays, but Caravaneer is such a unique series that I find myself returning to this work every once in a while.
    This is an unforgiving and long game, but if you use hacks like ArcadePreHacks, you can fly through the game and enjoy the story.
    Caravaneer 2 is a game that is heavy on story and manages to successfully build a post apocalyptic world set years after the entire world got turned into a desert.
    You have the opportunity to be a merchant and take advantage of changing economies.
    You can take part in politics and change how different factions interact with each other.
    There are many similarities to Fallout, but unlike the Fallout series, this seems to have a better thought out story and it feels like your actions actually have some weight despite its significantly lower budget and scale.
    I would like to see a sequel make it onto Steam, because it would be a shame for games like this fade into obscurity with the rest of the flash games.

    I think the last time I saw something with puppets was either Thunderbolt Fantasy or Sesamstraat.
    I don't know why they decided to use puppets, but it seems to work and effectively allows for the film to use more practical effects.
    This gives it somewhat of an 80's feel.
    Despite all that, I would consider this to be a unique, above average comedy.
    It seems to mix subtlety and over the top comedy to create an interesting commentary on the war on terror, American foreign policy, activist actors, and geopolitics.
    In spite of this, the issues are dated, making it difficult for viewers from a younger generation to fully appreciate the jokes.
    The best part of this film are the songs.
    The puppetry is not that sophisticated.
    The movie is aware of this, and pokes fun at the puppetry.

    The most in depth interview with Elon Musk that I have seen so far.
    It covers his entire life and is not afraid to get very technical.
    This interview hits many different areas such as finance, management, programming, manufacturing, materials science, and physics.
    It is a good video to remind you how engineers should approach problems and how technological progress should be conducted.
    I wish there was more on Neuralink, AI, and maybe even a little more on rocket technology, but there are other interviews and talks you can watch that more than make up for the deficiencies of this video.

    This is a book that covers the top 20 most spoken languages.
    While I don't like how information is presented, it does the job, and it provides useful information for any aspiring polyglots.
    Each language is given its own chapter, but what is discusssed for each language varies. Some chapters discuss words and grammar while other discuss culture and history.
    This inconsistency is what I find to be the largest problem with this book, but if you can get past that, you might find it to be palatable.
    One thing I appreciated was its coverage of loan words.
    It made it easier determine an order in which to learn languages based on which languages were influenced by others.
    E.g., learning Chinese before Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese, or learning Arabic before learning Persian, Turkish, Swahili and Hindi.

  explanation: >
    The cinematography in this film is its strongest point and it is all due to the skills of Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes.
    There are not many weak points in this film other than its premise.
    The attention to detail and the ambitious nature of the long takes makes it a film to be studied like Birdman and Rope.
    Every second of this film felt real and highly immersive.
    This is one of the few films I can think of that could actually be improved with a higher frame rate.
    In terms of WWI films, I consider this to be better than Paths of Glory.
    In terms of verisimilitude, the entirety of this film is comparable to the D-day sequence in Saving Private Ryan.
    In terms of quality, I'd say it is neck and neck with Saving Private Ryan where Saving Private Ryan had better character development and 1917 had better action and technical milestones.
    It is that great and it makes a strong case for more WWI movies.

  explanation: >
    A playlist of videos that make the mathematics of machine learning far more accessible.
    Granted, you don't know machine learning if you don't know how to use matrix representations of the concepts, but it is a good way to have a conceptual understanding of classifiers, regression, and other techniques.
    I'm not a big fan of the presentation style, and the videos tend to be towards the longer side, but I think that this is one of the better resources on Youtube for machine learning.
    This seems to lack certain concepts like Bayesian approaches, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and Laplacian point estimation which is unfortunate, but it is a good starting point.
    I would have also liked to have seen more on how to optimize hyperparameters, as well as a gradual progression into more mathematical representations of the concepts.
    This might be good for a programmer who just wants to know how the apply the concepts, but if you are in academia and are trying to do research, write a paper, or study for an exam, this is lacking.
    That said, resources for ML on youtube are either limited or lacking in pedagogical quality, so most people will need to settle for this.

    Unlike the Russel and Norvig textbook, this is more of a speculative book that fouses more on what may be possible rather than the current technology.
    It analyzes and extrapolates what may happen in the future as AI improves and how society and the human race will change as a result.
    It compares and contrasts many different scenarios. Overall, it is well thought out and well researched.
    There are many references to other works that I read such as Thinking Fast and Slow, Homo Deus, Sapiens, I Robot, etc.

  explanation: >
    I now use this in place of meditation because playing this game at high speeds allows me to easily enter the zone.
    This game is one of the best games I have ever played and it proves that the Tetris Effect is real.
    The game of Tetris is simple, but in combination with the sensory stimuli and effects powered by Unreal Engine 4 allows me to reach altered states very quickly.
    Although it does make players enter the zone, it does not do this artificially.
    You will actually become a decent Tetris player by the end of the journey mode if you play in normal or expert difficulty.
    I have never had a game do anything like this to me ever.
    It is imperfect, but the flaws can easily be improved.
    If speeds and difficulty can be adjusted as the player plays, this can allow for altered states to be entered far more quickly.
    A larger variety of music tracks and visuals would also be appreciated.
    Finally, if the game can take in biometric data like heart rate into account, I think it may be possible to do things other than just enter the zone.
    Highly recommended not only to gamers, but to everyone.
    I think this has therapeutic aspects that can be very <a href="https://youtu.be/7T7mg6JZZzg" target="_blank">useful</a>.

    The last film I saw on my Delta flight to Amsterdam.
    This one was above average, but it had holes.
    Character motivations seemed contradictory at times, but it was definitely thought provoking.
    The concept of a machine raising a child is something that isn't covered very much in fiction.
    Many ideas are presented, but I would have liked to have seen the exploration of a single idea at greater depth.
    It felt as though it were trying to tackle many themes at once, and I felt that weakened the film as a whole.
    It may be just me, but I feel that as I learn more about AI, the films about the subject don't seem to hold up with the most recent literature.

    It has been a while since I've seen an indie film with a low budget.
    Jim Cummings absolutely nails it not only with his directing, but with his acting as well.
    He singlehandedly sells the film and the long duration shots that had him really flex his acting chops made the film something special.
    I didn't seem to be the intended audience of this film with its themes of divorce, fatherhood, and loss.
    There were awkward moments in there due to the mix of comedy and heavy drama, but somehow Jim manages to make it work.

    This shows exactly what happened during the Apollo 11 mission and nothing else.
    There is no extraneous narration and all footage was footage taken during the mission.
    Picture quality is great, and you feel like you are experiencing exactly what the world experienced when the mission happened.
    It blows my mind that some of the sequences and shots they had were actually taken during the time of the mission.
    I didn't realize they had the technology for some of the techniques that were utilized at the time.

  explanation: >
    This is like a cyberpunk Uber simulator.
    Most of the game plays out like a sophisticated visual novel that takes place within a car.
    Concepts like automated driving vs human drivers, automation, quantum decryption and AI are touched upon.
    The emotions of the main character and the navigation of complicated conversations and social situations like handling gaslighting are well done.
    For an indie title, it is solid, but as a game, it is lacking in details.
    The world outside the cab feels almost desolate. You don't feel as though you are in a large city.
    It's a low budget game, so assets had to be kept to a minimum but additional details would have made it way better.
    I'm not asking for high graphical fidelity, but a more realistic world.

  explanation: >
    This one got better critical acclaim than it did with general audiences.
    I think I can understand why.
    Ad Astra is an introspective film that takes place in space.
    Unlike Interstellar or Gravity, this focuses more on relationships and seems to be deliberate and comparatively minimalistic.
    Other similar films focus more on action and suspense.
    Rather than comparing with more modern space films, this should be compared with Solyaris or 2001: A Space Odyssey.
    If you want a succint summary, this feels like a cross between Solyaris, 2001, and Apocalypse Now.
    That sounds like a pretty good combination to me.
    The focus is on character and cinematography, and I feel that it succeeds in that respect.
    In addition to this, while it is not completely realistic, it does seem real enough to seem possible.
    Similar to 2001, Ad Astra also hints at what commercial space travel and tourism might look like and it is very convincing.
    Overall, I feel that it is highly underrated and that we need more films like this in the genre.

    This is an arcade style game with storytelling in the style of Bastion.
    It draws from the exaggerations made in old western dime novels.

  explanation: >
    This reminded me of Studio Ghibli films like Nausicaa and Howl's Moving Castle.
    Like Nausicaa, there is a post apocalyptic steampunk aspect to this, and like Howl's Moving Castle, there is the aspect of controlling a large machine by running around and manually adjusting different things.
    Unlike some other games where you are the only character, this one has an exaggerated feeling of isolation because the setting makes you feel as though it is at least populated by other people.
    In that sense, it is somewhat similar to Machinarium.
    Far: Lone Sails also has a similar ambience.
    Like many others in the genre, it is a short and simple but satisfying.

    3Blue1Brown has the best animations and graphical representations, but this seems to have the best presentation of the topic in an engaging way.
    Khan Academy seems boring and long winded in comparison to this.
    This actually has thorough coverage of applications and does not merely present the abstract details.
    In addition to this, videos are short and compact.
    I think this is an underrated series given the high quality.
    I would have liked more details on eigenvalues, but I watched this for decent coverage of matrix algebra, so it served its task.
    If I have time, I'd like to view the next volume since that has Lagrange Multipliers, calculation of Nash Equilibrium and some coverage of linear regression which is very useful in machine learning.

  explanation: >
    P.T. is short for playable teaser. This was directed and designed by Hideo Kojima in collaboration with Guillermo Del Toro.
    Since I don't own a Ps4 and P.T. is no longer downloadable, I had to watch a playthrough instead which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/bjDmGGtglEY" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Compared to other games, this one is far more stripped down and has a very simple level design.
    The game is organized in an infinite loop where you explore different variations of the same floor over and over again.
    It was very surreal and very M.C. Escher"esque".
    Get rid of the colors, and you might have something close to Eraserhead.
    I did not know what to make of it.
    Any narrative was told through a radio and weird messages that show up on the walls of the building.
    As a game, it is lacking, but as a tech demo and teaser, I felt that it was effective.
    I think you have to play it to get the full experience.
    Having someone fly through the puzzles doesn't really allow one to have full appreciation for the game.

    With graduate school, I read a lot regarding learning, uncertainty, reinforcment learning, and a fair amount of the later half of the textbook.
    In my bachelors, I read a decent amount of the first half.
    I think this all adds up to me reading most of this textbook which has about 700+ pages of material.
    Total page count is about 1100 with a large part being exercises, appendixes, summaries and other complementary information typically found in a textbook.
    The Russell, Norvig textbook was written by experts in the field, and the most recent editions have been updated to include more modern techniques and discoveries.
    This is THE book for AI.
    I found this to be well written, but explanations regarding algorithms could have been structured better.
    With this, I have a fairly decent understanding of AI and its limitations.
    If there is one thing I got out of this, it is that we have a long way to go.
    That said, there are some very interesting applications that can be made using current techniques that will still be disruptive.
    We don't necessarily need general AI to accelerate the progress of civilization.
    Modern techniques offer quite a number of possiblities, and it is not necessary to wait for the silver bullet of general AI to discover the potential of AI.

    This game is highly minimalistic and shares many similarities to Journey.
    Similarly, there seems to be some sort of hero's journey, and a mythology that governs the world of Gris.
    Like the art design, the music is also minimal.
    It all works, and the gameplay is simple and easy to follow.
    In terms of art direction, this game is one of the best indie games I played this year.

  explanation: >
    Based on what I remember of the source material, this film falls short.
    It's not bad, but it's also not good.
    The world in the film is a bit more vibrant and less brutal than the world in Gunm.
    Part of what made the source material so compelling was an idea of hope in the face of desolation and incredible suffering.
    This movie lacks that and all of the philosophical musings that came with it.
    In that sense, the OVA that came out decades ago excels where this fails.
    Technical aspects and acting are well done, but a movie needs to have a compelling story and characters first and foremmost.
    Finally, there were instances where I had flashbacks to Sharkboy and Lavagirl. That should be somewhat telling.
    I don't think Robert Rodriguez's directing style works for this film, but he also has not directed a movie I would consider great within the past 8 years, so maybe I should not be so surprised.

    Sayonara Wild Hearts is an arcade style music game that has a mix of endless runner and shmup style gameplay.
    The visuals are a beautiful mix in the style of outrun and matches the music.
    The music is also very well done with a mixture of synths and vocals.
    Gameplay is dynamic and changes between different modes based on your place in the music.
    It is not overly difficult, and as long as you have average reflexes, you should be able to finish in a short period of time.
    This is not a genre that I am a fan of, but this game's creativity has won me over.
    Finally, Queen Latifah as the narrator is like icing on a highly polished final product.

  explanation: >
    Story is not the strong point of the John Wick series and this movie is no exception, but if you came for great action, this movie delivers.
    This is a film that tries not to be smarter than it actually is and just delivers great stunts and set pieces.
    It is stylistic. The editing is not spastic like other lesser action films, and in regards to stunts, they had some of the best in the industry for this one.
    I don't think there was a weak link in terms of acting. No one here will take home an Oscar, but I think everyone did their part well with Keanu Reeves successfully selling his role as John Wick.
    When it comes to action, John Wick 3 is creative, visceral, and it does not cut corners in any way.
    You will see gun fights on horses, incredible usage of trained dogs, and good gunwork.
    It's definitely worth watching.

    A Story About My Uncle is a platforming game that starts out as a bedtime story.
    The story itself is nothing to write home about and the graphics are unsophisticated.
    So the platforming must be good right?
    It's actually mixed.
    The ideas presented are interesting and the mechanics are used well, but the platforming itself felt unbalanced.
    Hitboxes seemed to not match what was rendered on the screen, and grappling did not seem to follow the laws of physics exactly.
    To put it simply, this game is unpolished, but the short playtime makes the flaws a little less of a problem.

    Dynasty Warriors 2 was one of the first games I ever played and it is interesting to see how it is in one of its most recent incarnations.
    Graphics are unimpressive, the gameplay is still the same as it was 10 years ago and like most Koei Tecmo games, it is a buggy mess.
    That said, I seemed to have no problems with these things due to nostalgia and my appreciation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
    There is something satisfying about mowing down hundreds of enemies in historical China.
    This installment has more than just the three kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu. It also has a campaign for Jin (the Sima clan) and a campaign for Lu Bu.
    In addition to this, it also has more playable characters and many of the officers are no longer faceless mooks like they were in previous installments.
    I managed to make it through all the campaigns except for Wei and Shu due to those campaigns crashing for me after certain missions.
    So would I recommend it? Not at all. Did I have fun? Yes.

    I wish this show was around when I was younger. It truly makes me want to reverse engineer everything I see to find out how they work.
    It covers chemistry and its applications in a basic and accessible way in a context where the introduction of scientific ideas isn't forced.
    In addition to that, it offers suggestions on how to rebuild modern human technology starting with a level of technology matchin that of the stone age.
    Dr. Stone is a shounen anime, so it falls into some of the tropes that come with the genre.
    As a result, pacing isn't the best, but it gets better in the second half.
    There are moments in here that have impressed me.
    The idea that you can create a human powered electric generator using stone age technology is something I never would thought of.
    The importance of fire and pinpoint heating helped to explain why humanity took so long to go from the stone age to the iron and bronze ages.
    While there is a requirement for suspension of disbelief, there is quite a bit of science in here that is legitimate.
    This is a show that is rich in ideas. Its execution isn't perfect, but I found it enjoyable.

    This is an addicting sandbox.
    I initially played on survival mode, but switched to creative mode to have a bit more freedom and to save time.
    It was still time consuming despite this, because of the massive underwater world that required hours of exploration.
    I think freedom mode would be the best mode because it would better emphasize the crafting aspect, but if you are not a fan of spending hours farming for resources, creative mode can't be beat.
    The world itself is rather detailed. It has many biomes and large amounts of biodiversersity.
    The unique setting and story provides a background that has a bit of urgency and a lot of wonder.
    This is a well made game that never dragged.

    Probably the worst movie I saw out of the three on my flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.
    This had the most lazy god awful writing I've witnessed in a long time.
    Dialogue is predictable and I didn't care about any of the characters.
    Aquaman basically took bits and pieces from many superhero films and created a Frankenstein of a film.
    Action scenes were mainly CGI and lacked creativity.
    Before watching this film, I was curious to see how Aquaman could be made interesting.
    After watching this film, I realized that the only redeemable thing about this was Jason Momoa's personality and Nicole Kidman's acting.

    This is a mixed one that had a lot of potential.
    There is some great imagery here.
    Scenes of Earth traveling through space, its atmosphere being swallowed up by Jupiter are absolutely sublime.
    This is despite the CGI looking very fake when compared to films produced by Hollywood.
    The emphasis on people across the world coming together was appreciated.
    Pacing is not that great and the characters suck.
    There are some cliché tropes that show up here.
    If you've seen a Chinese film before, you probably are familiar with certain stereotypes that show up here.

    Another self help book.
    This one was more intended for the average Joe trying to get a leg up on life.
    Generally speaking, there was not much I got out of it.
    There is nothing here that isn't presented in other books in a better way.
    The only thing I got out of this was to love yourself.

    Ocean Cleanup was on my radar, but I never actually looked into it until now.
    I never realized that Ocean Cleanup was founded in the Netherlands and that Boyan Slat attended TU Delft.
    Leave it to the Dutch to do something interesting under the radar.
    Boyan Slat knows every technical aspect of the project he is working on and there are not many founders who have that level of knowledge.
    I've never really been all that interested in reusability because so many people are already working on it, but now I am seeing that there are many aspects to reusability that many people are unaware of I am starting to see it in a new light.

    Finally got to the end of this. This is surprisingly dense despite the low number of pages.
    Stephen Hawking covers much of the science that is used in modern physics today from Netownian mechanics, to quantum theory, to imaginary time.
    Despite it being meant for a more general audience, it is not an easy read.
    The documentary based off of this may be easier to digest, but I have not seen it.

  explanation: >
    This is a good documentary that covers the five games played by AlphaGo and the preparation that occurred before the games.
    It does not get too technical, but it does go over the three network architecture of the agent.
    This film is more focused on the go side of things, but the opinions and commentary of Lee Sedol and Fan Hui were useful.
    It provided an inside look that could not be seen by watching the games.
    This was overall an enjoyable experience and made me excited to learn about reinforcement learning over the next few weeks.

    The Man from Earth was a great thought provoking film. This sequel was not that.

    I used D3 when working as an engineer, but I need a refresher since I will be taking a course in Data Visualization and the library has had some changes since.

    This tutorial is nothing special, but it is brief.
    Covers basic graphs, scales, and axes. Circular graphs are not covered at the level of detail I would have liked.

    This was a conversation about Neuralink which covered the future of human augmentation.
    There was a bit about Tesla's work to have their cars navigate parking lots, but this podcast was mostly about Neuralink.
    As a fan of Ghost in the Shell and Deus Ex, it is good to see efforts towards human augmentation actually being realized in some form.
    The final note on the Pale Blue Dot was a nice way to conclude everything and remind us all of how insignificant we all truly are.

    This Red Bull BC One was not as enjoyable for me as others.
    The judging felt somewhat predictable up until the end and there was very little sense of suspense up through the quarterfinals.
    That said, the crowd in Mumbai was great, and the final battle was incredible.
    I loved how they just added extra rounds.
    Menno may have won over the judges, but Killa Kolya definitely won over the crowd.
    The bgirl battles were entertaining as well.
    Commentary from Ronnie was better appreciated than the usual commentators.

  explanation: >
    Watched this at Pathé in standard quality as a way to recover after exams.
    I would have prefered Imax, but availability of Imax screens in the Netherlands is low.
    That said, it was one of the best experiences I had watching in standard quality even though there were Dutch subtitles.
    Joker is the current's generation Taxi Driver and it is easy to forget that it is a comic book film.
    It is operatic, artistic, and often indulgent in nature.
    Similar to a Scorsese film, it values story over plot, but it places less emphasis on dialogue and more emphasis on image.
    It also pays homage to many older films.
    Every frame is beautiful, hypnotizing and most shots seem deliberate.
    The music is dramatic and reminded me of Pink Floyd's The Wall at times.
    Hildur Guðnadóttir is a talented composer and her music reminded me of Jóhann Jóhannsson's work due to its brooding nature.
    It was only afterwards that I realized that Hildur is Icelandic as well.
    In addition to this, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one of his best and rivals Daniel Day-Lewis'  performance in There will be Blood.
    Although there are scenes where it might drag and the movie as a whole is not perfect, I found Joker to be one of those rare films that I will revisit in the future.

  explanation: >
    In terms of hard sci-fi, this show was way better than it had any right to be.
    I don't remember the last time I had my mind blown, but some of the twists and reveals in the second part of this show took me by complete surprise.
    What follows will contain spoilers.
    Kanata no Astra derives its title from the latin phrase Per aspera ad astra. This is where the film Ad Astra also derives its title from.
    The show follows the standard tropes of a Shounen anime, but takes things to the next level with its thoughtful premise.
    Concepts like illegal cloning for the purpose of expanding longevity, revisionism of history, and weaponized wormholes are covered.
    It also includes one of the only representations of an intersex human I have seen in media.
    I wish it would have also included time dilation. It seems like the show played loose with relativity, but this may have allowed for the show to be more accessible for the scientifically illiterate.
    If you are used to genre tropes in Shounen anime and are willing to suspend disbelief, this is definitely worth the time.

  explanation: >
    I recommend watching at 1.25x speed.
    Michio Kaku is far more philosophical and far more forward thinking in the content he presents when compared to other science personalities that appear on TV.
    This podcast covers the future of human existence, the nature of information in the universe as well as the limitations of deriving ethics from science.
    Overall, I found this to be very thought provoking.

  explanation: >
    I am currently reading through A Brief History of Time, so I thought this movie might make a decent companion piece and serve as inspiration for studying.
    This was not the case, because the film is full of historical inaccuracies, and it does not focus on the science.
    This is disappointing because it has great cinematography and a great soundtrack by Jóhann Jóhannsson.
    In addition to this, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones were terrific in their roles.
    One thing people might be confused about coming into this film is that this is a film about Stephen Hawking.
    This is incorrect, because it is based on a memoir by Jane Hawking.
    The film might be better if it focused on Jane Hawking, but it seems to split its attention between Stephen Hawking and Jane Hawking which ultimately degrades the script.
    It is a good film, but it lacks focus.

    A high level overview of differential equations.
    I did not expect to completely understand everything about differential equations, but this overview gives a sampling platter of topics in the area.

    It also helped to highlight some of the shortcomings of the class I am taking right now which emphasizes technique without philosophy.
    There is a reason why his textbooks include a section on philosophy, and the fact that he made a point of that in this podcast shows that blindly using the techniques within his textbook without any considerations of implications they may bring is mistaken.

  explanation: >
    I was unable to watch this live due to the time differences.
    Musk starts off with his usual spiel about being a multiplanetary species, but once he finishes with that, he gets down to details and presents the technical details.
    The largest improvement in the Starship design is the usage of 301 stainless steel which is far cheaper than whatever carbon composite or aluminium composite that was being considered before.
    This presentation also covers the design of the heat shield to prevent cracking under extreme heat.
    Interestingly, Musk mentioned that refueling in orbit is more trivial than docking with the space station.
    Finally, another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzFQJUzoUvM" target="_blank">simulation</a> involving the Superheavy and Starship has been made with the updated designs.
    Some of the timelines presented here are ambitious even for Musk, but if it is him, we may see a fully functional Starship Superheavy combo in 2 years.
    On another note, I really liked what he said about schedules. If it's long, it's wrong. If it's tight, it's right.

    A game that is short enough that I could finish it between breaks.
    Superhot is a game that manages to do a lot with a simple premise and in the process, it ends up being very thought provoking even though the the story is rather simple.
    The primary mechanic is that time will only flow when you move. This allows you to dodge bullets, cut bullets out of the air with a sword, and do things that wouldn't be possible with a traditional fps.
    Later in the game, you gain the ability to transfer your conciousness to enemy characters which adds another layer of freedom to the game.
    I found this to be very similar to the Matrix despite in being not as wordy or philosophical. Great way to let off steam.

  explanation: >
    In the 50's and 60's, Westerns were a more romanticized genre that had a certain veneer about it. In the 60's and 70's, the western became more violent, but also more stylized.
    This film draws from those eras, but also adds a dose of realism and cynicism to its voice.
    In addition to being directed by Clint Eastwood, it was written by David Webb Peoples who was one of the writers of Blade Runner.
    Unforgiven is a film that is on the level of other great Westerns like The Searchers and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
    I found its third act to be particularly well done and thought the dialogue was better written than some of the classic Westerns directed by John Ford and Sergio Leone.

  explanation: >
    Although this is a tale of adolescence, it doesn't fall within the traditional trope of a coming of age story.
    In that sense, it is somewhat subversive, but the story is not the strongest point of this film.
    The strongest aspect of this film is the camera work.
    The way the objects inside of the frame tell the story and the way movement is used is quite different from other films during the time that played things by the book.
    I had flashbacks to Scorsese and Kubrick films that used similar shots, but came after this film was released.
    There is an obvious stylistic influence on directors who saw this film during their formative years and its role as a film that is representative of the French New Wave is well deserved.

    Tom Cruise is getting older, but his stunts are getting more and more elaborate. Fallout is, in my opinion, a great example of Hollywood style action.
    Set pieces are great and the locations are well thought out. Camera work is deliberate and everything seems to have been well thought out.

  explanation: >
    Probably the last game I will have the time to complete for a while. Borderlands 2 is like Borderlands 1, but it is bigger and seems to have an emphasis on coop play.
    This can make it frustrating for anyone who is playing solo. Also, because of the lack of weapons types and abilities, it can come across as repetitive.
    In terms of the looter shooter genre, this seems to be one of the best, but I think it was definitely made for multiplayer.
    It has much of the same type of humor as the previous entry, but if you want to live in the world of Pandora without dealing with some of the more frustrating elements of the game, you might be better off playing Tales from the Borderlands instead.

      Space elevators, skyhooks, and orbital rings are the trinity of methods to allow payloads to reach space very cheaply.
      Although the space industry is currently obsessed with rockets, if you want truly sustainable space travel at a very cheap price, the orbital ring is the gold standard for getting into space.
      If such infrastructure exists, multistage rockets might become obsolete, and single stage rockets launched directly from orbit for interplanetary travel may become the next new thing.

      Thunderbolt Fantasy is the result of a collaboration between Japanese and Taiwanese companies.
      The story draws from old samurai and swordsman stories like the Seven Samurai and is set in a world similar to the kind seen in Chinese Xuanhuan novels.
      It truly is a mixture of cultural tropes, and the main selling point of glove puppetry only makes it all the more unique.
      There is very little like it, and the only things that might be even remotely comparable are the works of Studio Laika, and The Dark Crystal.

  explanation: >
      A browser game that emulates what it is like to live with depression.
      Any choices that allow one to recover from the disorder are scratched out, making the game very linear with very little choice.
      It could be that this was intended to simulate the downward spiral associated with depression, but it it also sacrificed depth as a result.
      I find this design choice to be questionable, because it is possible to recover from depression.
      If there is no choice, there is no point.
      As a result, this was a rather unenjoyable game that seems to have been made to educate and make a point rather than to entertain.
      I think it can be improved if there was more choice or at least an explanation of how choice is understood and considered within the context of this game.

  explanation: >
      This movie introduces Shazam and also offers a preview of the Shazam kids.
      It is humorous and doesn't get into any heavy themes.
      In many ways, it feels like it is following the Marvel formula and shares similarities with Dr. Strange, but lacks many of the metaphysical aspects as well as the complicated special effects of the later work.
      It isn't anything special, but it is a fun time and if DC continues with this level of quality, they may be able to have something on par with the Marvel universe in the future.

  explanation: >
      It's like Journey, but not quite.
      The soundtrack by Austin Wintory is in spectacular form and the art direction is identical to what may be found in Thatgamecompany's games.
      However, the narrative structure and level design is different.
      Abzû's level design is more simplistic, but at the same time there is more on screen.
      Giant Squid Studios successfully replicates some of the mystery of our oceans and in the process sacrifices the feelings of isolation and spirituality that was present in Journey.
      This sacrifice seems intentional, because Abzû is going for something different.
      Abzû is not necessarily going for feelings of the spiritual kind, but rather the primeval.
      The Sumerian origins of the game's title seems to support this.
      As such, it may not bring out introspection like Journey, but a different kind of externally directed feeling towards the expansiveness of our reality that is very difficult to describe.
      In many ways, this feels like a companion piece to Journey that tries to do what Journey did not to create a complete whole.
      I feel like it succeeded, but I would have preferred a more clear emotional narrative like Flower or Journey.

  explanation: >
      It is amazing how something as lifeless as rock can have so many dimensions and features.
      While the movie Free Solo focuses on Alex Honnold's free solo climb of El Capitan, it manages to also successfully express the depth involved in the world of rock climbing.
      It talks about the risks, the techniques, and the history.
      In addition to this, the editing made an activity as slow and methodical as free soloing an exciting affair.
      A great documentary deserving of its awards.

  explanation: >
      I wanted to read something in Japanese, but reading an entire novel seemed like a chore, so I settled for this.
      I remember buying this in a Book Off when I was in Japan for the first time.
      Unlike the animated series, this seems slower paced.
      That's not to say that the original source is any less of an urban jungle, or any less kinetic, but there is a little more fat on the bone with this one.
      They don't make manga like this anymore, so the subject matter is still fresh.
      The idea of rollerblades on steroids to do high speed parkour is still interesting and the feelings of freedom that accompany the premise are still there.
      That said, there are a few small things that annoyed me when I was reading this.
      Often times, there is incorrect Japanese or simply incorrect furigana accompanying the kanji.
      This could be due to the characters speaking in a rough manner, but it made what should have been an easy read a little bit harder.

  explanation: >
      Among all of the film adaptations of Broadway musicals that I have seen, Les Misérables has the best cinematography.
      This is not too surprising because Tom Hooper directed The King's Speech before this.
      That said, the camera shakes a little too much for my liking.
      One of the things I found surprising was that the music was actually not up to par with other musicals.
      One of the reasons for this is singing ability.
      The cast can sing, but for some reason, they always sound out of breath.
      I'm not sure if this was a directorial decision, but I found that it took away from the impact.
      My general impression is that this is just below what is expected of a great film, and improvements in sound and pacing would have raised my opinion of the work.

      This is said to be the best Far Cry game and also the game with the best story in the series.
      While it has less realism than Far Cry 2, this does not diminish the gameplay.
      One thing I noticed is that it seems to have many similarities to the Assassin's Creed games in terms of game mechanics.
      This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on whether you have the patience to explore the open world presented.
      Vaas is a well written villain and a memorable one.
      In regards to the open world, there are many places to explore, but the islands seem pretty much the same throughout, and the npc's lack depth.
      It is designed well for eating up time, but not so much for making meaningful memories in its world.
      I recommend first capturing radio towers, then finishing the hunting missions, and finally the steamrolling through game's story for the best experience and minimal fuss.

  explanation: >
      Chicago is one of the longest running Broadway musicals, so I was interested in seeing how a stage musical would be adapted to film.
      It's done rather well, but it's not for me.
      The songs used the jazz of the 1920's as a basis to create catchy tunes, and the acting was well executed as well.
      Due to its satirical nature, I personally found that there were no characters I could relate to or identify with.
      If you're into tap or jazz dance, this might be for you, but in film, I believe that story is most important and I did not like the story in this one.

  explanation: >
      I really liked this musical. Despite the name, you actually don't need to know anything about opera before seeing this.
      The operas referred to within this play are fictional and don't even exist.
      The music is also very accessible with electric guitar parts and lyrics intended to win over a larger audience.
      The story is a mixture of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Beauty and the Beast.
      Like those titles, this has the appeal of a disney film and it ends up being rather meta as well.
      There is a certain 4th wall breaking aspect to the play due to the fact that there are stage sequences inside of a staged work.

      I'm not the biggest fan of the Jojo series, but I keep watching it so that I can keep up with the memes.
      I personally liked the second part the best because it did not have stands, but now that we are on part five, I can say that this manages to take the concept of a 'Stand' to a new level.
      There are tons of Stand battles and, at this point, Araki Hirohiko has gotten rather skilled at using the limitations and strengths of Stands to draw out as much suspense as possible.
      It also helps that characters have exaggerated reactions and characteristics.
      Overall, I found this to be an entertaining entry.

      Emulated and upscaled through PCSX2.
      Ico is one of the greatest games ever made for good reason.
      Ico is great in the classical sense.
      It tells a simple story of companionship and isolation and draws from many ancient cultures such as ancient Greece and Rome for architecture and storytelling, and ancient Japan and ancient China for geography, language, mythology, clothing and everything else.
      The puzzles use simple mechanics in multiple different ways to create variety.
      Due to its age, the combat mechanics are nothing special, but they don't take anything particularly away from the work as a whole.
      Despite it being overshadowed by Shadow of the Colossus (which I played as a child), it manages to sufficiently stand up on its own and lay the technical and stylistic groundwork for Fumito Ueda's later works.
      Similarly, many of Jenova Chen's works seem to have many stylistic elements taken from Ico.
      This is an important work that is often unfairly overlooked. I highly recommend it.

      Is having the heroine die from sickness a common opera trope?
      Anyways, the story begins like a bad joke where a poet, a painter, a singer, and a musician all walk into a bar.
      Despite the characters having different professions, I found it funny that everyone including the singer could sing.
      La Boheme, unlike other opera entries did not have highly technical music, and in some ways, it came across as cliche.
      Despite this, the delivery of the story was a great reflection of the time in which it was made, and it managed to balance comedy, tragedy and drama rather well.
      I would consider this better than The Magic Flute, but not better than Carmen or La Traviata.

  explanation: >
      When I saw that there was a part 2, I thought they were selling out, but I could not have been more wrong.
      This entry elevates the series to become one of the greatest works of Japanese animation and puts it on the same level as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Steins;Gate in my opinion.
      The first half had action on a scale similar to Lord of the Rings with pacing and stakes that was similar to Mad Max Fury Road.
      The second half finally provides answers to questions that were asked in previous seasons and subtly introduces philosophical questions and concepts.
      There were allusions to World War II, gestures to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and a healthy dose of cynicism to keep everything from getting pretentious.
      This does everything right, the payoff is amazing, and we're still not at the end.
      Regardless of whether everything ends with a bang or a whimper, I am confident that the ending will be thoughtfully constructed and provided with the same high quality treatment we have seen in previous entries.

  explanation: >
      It is strange seeing Eric Weinstein with his boss, but somehow this conversation manages to work due to its subject matter.
      There are topics presented here that I don't usually see being talked about such as the technological stagnation we are currently experiencing.
      While it may be true that there are many gradualistic advances in technology, there are very few fundamental saltatory improvements in the technology we currently use.
      This is why technology appears to be stagnant. Simply put, there are no new discoveries being made. We are simply finding new ways to use the discoveries that were made in the past.
      The second topic that is covered at length is the counterproductive nature of higher education and academia within the United States and the damages caused by those running the larger institutions that fall within this category.
      All in all, I found that this was a thoughtful conversation that examined a problem many have not even acknowledged.

      Back in the day before computer manufacturers just assembled parts and just made things fit within a chasis, there were companies that built entire computers from scratch.
      This is one such story.
      This is not the story of a company starting small and then making it big.
      It is just the story of how a single computer (Eagle) in Data General was made from beginning to end.
      Many of the things here were all too familiar to me since I was an engineer, but since it was in a different industry, during a different time, I found it interesting to see what people were concerned about back then.
      Needless to say, not much has changed over forty years.

  explanation: >
      I'm sick and tired of Mozart.
      I hear his stuff everywhere and I have trouble enjoying it anymore.
      It sounds like a bunch of arpeggios and scales to me with nothing to distinguish it from other classical music-- almost as if a mindless computer wrote it.
      The story of the Magic Flute is simple, but it makes up for its simplicity for its imagery and symbolism.
      Vocals are also very technical.
      German is rather similar to Dutch, so I found myself understanding some of the content without needing subtitles.

  explanation: >
      The Breakfast Club is unorthodox in its organization, but it manages to work because it places all of its actors in one room and asks the simple question of what happens.
      There are no weak links because of its small cast.
      While it does not necessarily say the most profound things in its main message, this coming of age story is fun to watch from beginning to end and does not drag at all.

  explanation: >
      This book, in my opinion, was almost perfect for its first half.
      Because it is a young adult novel, the prose is simpler than other works, but it still read beautifully.
      Books don't need to be a convoluted mess of high diction to be good and this novel is a testament to that fact.
      In terms of characters, all of the characters are given an appropriate amount of attention and the emotional weight of their struggles are carried to the reader rather effectively.
      In regards to the hard sci-fi themes that show up later in the book, they are explored rather well in the first half, but never truly explored in depth in the later half.
      I don't think Patrick Ness is a sci-fi writer, so this may be easily forgiven if he focused more on the struggles of the individual characters rather than fill pages with strange detours in the later half.
      This book had so much potential, and that is why I like it, but it is not a perfect book.
      If you read just the first half and stop there, you may actually enjoy it better.
      That said, the ending was rather thoughtful, so I'll leave it up to your judgement.

  explanation: >
      My second opera. This time, instead of a film, I watched the full production with subtitles.
      I was originally watching the Royal Opera's version, but for some reason, they dropped the subtitles, so I finished with the Taomina Festival version.
      Unlike the Royal Opera (which has Carmenita in a gorilla suit for some reason), the Taormina Festival version was far more faithful to the source material.
      This made it far more accessible to me. In terms of story, I felt that Carmen was better than La Traviata, but did not have the same level of vocal technicality as La Traviata.
      The characters were more understandable this time around, and I found it interesting that I didn't like Carmenita, but actually rooted for Micaëla.
      The music, in my opinion was the best part. This was, in many ways, a compilation of best hits of Georges Bizet and that worked to its strengths.
      Unlike older operas, the music here had something of a unique oriental flavor that set it apart from other operas that were far more rigid due to their classical occidental influences.

  explanation: >
      We see some old faces in this one like Soap and Price.
      While this is a continuation of the first modern warfare, there are some differences in style.
      The first difference is that while the first modern warfare was more realistic, this was a little more over the top like a Hollywood blockbuster.
      This made for some very interesting levels with high stakes, but in the process, it lost a little bit of what made the first modern warfare great.
      The soundtrack by Lorne Balfe and Hans Zimmer was well done and better executed in this entry.
      Overall, it is a great game that went by very quickly, but it does not seem to reach the heights that were reached by its predecessor.

      This is a book that is highly dependent on suspension of disbelief.
      It may be because of the age of the work, but the timescale that the Old Ones operate within is simply unrealistic.
      Despite this, the main premise and the creeping dread involved with the subject matter make for an interesting story.

  explanation: >
      I saw the first film in the trilogy and heard that the rest of the Hobbit Trilogy was a bloated mess, so I decided to watch the Maple Films edit instead.
      This version is rather faithful to the source material and cuts out much of the fat to create a tighter story.
      Unlike what I've seen of the trilogy previously, this came across as coherent.
      While Lord of the Rings was a story of Men and Hobbits, this was a coherent story of Dwarves and a single Hobbit.
      That said, I do think it is a bit long for one book and it does not match the scale of Lord of the Rings.

      The animation was way better than it had any right to be.

      Read the extended version.
      Stephen King is an author who is capable of flailing around in the darkness and grabbing a decent story without planning it.
      By planting seeds and symbols throughout the post apocalyptic novel, he was able to add many different layers.
      There is the Dark Man who shows up in many of Stephen King's novels.
      There is the biblical and supernatural aspects that mirror the rapture.
      And finally, there is the intricacies of human nature in all its beauty and ugliness.
      This is Stephen King's War and Peace.
      It isn't consistent in terms of quality throughout, but it is a great book with depth that manages to be entertaining.

      It can be used to restore certain faculties of the mind for those who have some form of nerve or brain damage.

  explanation: >
      This book was highly impactful for me. The first chapter in particular was very useful.
      Inner Engineering is split into two parts.
      The first focuses on Sadhguru's experiences and the shortcomings of modern society to foster joy.
      The second focuses on yogic principles framed in a modern context.
      It also provides activities that can be followed to train the mind.
      Much of the book is organized in such a way that you can focus your efforts on what you struggle with.
      If you want to have a better grasp on how to handle your emotional needs and approach life in a more joyful manner, you will find this book very helpful.

      Michael Cimino made one good movie and this is it.
      There are many Vietnam films, but this is one that stands closer to the top.
      I wouldn't consider it to be as good as Apocalypse Now, but I think it is rather close.
      The Russian roulette scenes were the best parts of the film.
      Not only were they brutal, but they could draw out an incredible amount of suspense in short bursts.
      It also helped that the acting of Robert Deniro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep elevated the film higher.
      Although it is a bit long, I consider it to be essential viewing.

      A great way to review different common algorithms.
      It even covered concepts I was not explicitly taught in school such as bitwise operations for increasing performance as well as memoization.
      One thing to note is that solutions provided here aren't perfect and seem to have an unusual focus on recursion.

      I forgot how great of an actor Robin Williams was, and this movie was very effective in reminding me of that.
      All this film needs is more Robin Williams and more poetry, and it would be perfect.
      There are not many films that touch on the subject of nonconformity, but this acts like a primer in the art.

      The final installment tries to tread the same ground as the 1995 film, but does not make any deep emotional or philosophical conclusions.
      This time, it presents the possibilities of fused conciousnesses, single conciousnesses that can diverge, and multiple people sharing one body.
      In the future, the concept of a body will fundamentally change and become separated from one's identity.
      As our humanity becomes more abstract, it will be interesting to see how we maintain or try to maintain the things we believe makes us human.

      My first opera.
      Anna Mofo was terrific as Violetta.
      The story was not anything complex, but the vocal gymnastics involved was just insane.
      Also, it was interesting to see the context of Verdi's music.
      I have typically just listened to the music of Verdi, but now I understand what scenes they were used for.
      Opera is truly an interesting genre.
      Every bit of dialogue is sung, but unlike broadway plays, the vocal talent required is higher and there is less choreography.
      It is not very accessible due to the language, however. I recommend watching operas with dual subtitles to get the best experience.

  explanation: >
      My second Walter Isaacson book. The general impression I have is that people have an opinion of Steve Jobs that ignores his flaws.
      Bill Burr makes this point in one of his interviews.
      This book does not simply praise, and Walter Isaacson shows both the good and the bad.
      Steve Jobs had successes and failures, and Walter Isaacson covers all of it.
      Unlike the film, this also covers his childhood and his identity as an adopted child.
      A worthwhile read. I don't identify with Steve Jobs, but I understand him better after completing this book.

  explanation: >
      A short but memorable game that evokes feelings of spirituality through its surreal nature and game mechanics.
      Gorogoa's strengths lie in its visual style.
      It is through this visual style that the player feels like they are brought into the pages of a picture book or a 2d dream.
      The soft music with experimental electronics only serve to further that surreal nature of the game.
      There is a story being told throughout the levels, but because nothing is concretely explained, it is up to the player to offer their own interpretation.

  explanation: >
      Interestingly, tomorrow is the 60th anniversary of this film.
      North by Northwest is a fun, delightful film by Hitchcock. Possibly my favorite of his works.
      In my opinion Eva Marie Saint stole the spotlight.
      This is probably the closest Hitchcock would ever get to directing a James Bond film.
      It's suspensful, intriguing, and the premise is original.
      Set pieces are well made, and none of the scenes bore.
      For a film from the late 1950's, this manages to entertain even today.

      This is a weaker entry, but it does address certain ideas that will become concerns once human augmentation becomes mainstream.

      R is a great language for displaying data.
      I think Python has more flexibility because of all the libraries that can be brought in through PIP, but I can see why many statisticians prefer R.

      I'm trying to get into Broadway plays and this is the first play to introduce me to the genre.
      In terms of accessibility, I think this is a good play to start with.
      I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I saw it as a child.
      The story is simple and much of the emphasis is placed on choreography and music.
      The level of athleticism required for the roles in this play is high, and as someone with a dance background, it made for a decent work to study.
      Memories is a good song, and it has qualities similar to many of the songs in West Side Story that allow for its impact last well beyond the viewing of the play.

  explanation: >
      Night in the Woods is a game with anthropomorphic characters that takes place in a small, struggling town with a dwindling population.
      This is a game that focuses not on gameplay, but on story.
      The story itself is above average.
      While I would not call it a coming of age tale, it shares many qualities of that style of story with Life is Strange.
      Similarly, Mae, the main character, walks slowly, talks slowly, and it takes a long time to do simple things which artificially lengthens the play time.
      Where the story truly shines is in its third act where mysteries are solved and arcs are concluded.
      Its focus on story helps, and I hope others follow its example while taking care to actually focus on the quality of the story similar to how screenwriters craft the flow and pacing of a film.

      A very accessible book about structural engineering and the many considerations that go into structures.

      Readers will leave with knowledge of what stress and strain is.
      In addition to this, aesthetic decisions and the art that goes into structures is spoken about at some length.
      The only thing it does not cover is how materials behave at different temperatures, but it might have been intentional to leave that out due to the complexities of thermodynamics.

      This series is starting to grow on me.
      I find it quite a bit more enjoyable when I consider it as an episode in the context of a series instead of a standalone film.
      This entry is bigger and more action packed than the first film.
      Action sequences are well thought out and coordinated in a way that is only comparable to The Matrix.
      You'd have to wonder which work drew its influence from which.
      We also start seeing mentions of the concept of a ghost which may mean that quality will be increasing in the following films.
      The soundtrack by Cornelius is also starting to improve.

      A solid film albeit a bit predictable.
      From a technical standpoint, it does not disappoint.
      Images are vibrant and movement is fluid.
      As a guitar player, this definitely played to my tastes and some of the songs were catchy.
      Story-wise, it does not do anything groundbreaking and I was able to figure out what would happen in the third act because it dropped too many hints.
      Portrayals of Mexico tend to be rather negative in Hollywood, so this film with its bright colors, positive outlook on death and emphasis on family is a welcome change.

      The original 1995 film was a huge influence on me and I am glad to enter that world once more.
      Ghost Pain is the first entry in a series of four films that act as something of an origin story for Section 9 and a refresh of the IP.
      With a different director behind the camera, one should expect different results.
      There are fewer existential questions being asked, the scale is smaller, the music is more subtle and drawn back.
      In terms of emotional punch, it is definitely inferior to the original TV series as well as the original films, but it still somehow manages to be thought provoking.
      They don't censor the violence, and the content is not dumbed down for a modern audience.

  explanation: >
      A gem of a film that is about parenthood and childhood with a twist.
      It should come to no surprise given the number of awards it has won.
      Mamoru Hosada is a skilled director whose films I have seen before.
      The last film of his that I have seen is Summer Wars, and that was more than 6 years ago.
      While the scale of this story is not quite at the level of Summer Wars, the smaller scale allows it to be a more touching story that is able to connect with its viewers due to its personal touch.
      Single parenthood in Japan is not often covered in film, so this film in particular was covering new ground while telling an original tale of its own during the time it was released.

      A crime drama in the vein of The Departed that takes place in the United States.
      In terms of plot construction, it does not break new ground, but its treatment of gangs in the U.S. is interesting.
      To see a Japanese treatment of American culture is fascinating, and although there are some strange stylistic choices, they pay enough attention to the details to provide a rewarding drama from beginning to end.

      It was not for me, but it is an above average romance film.
      Scenes of opulence might impress initially, but I feel like it won't be all that impressive after time passes and will degrade with multiple viewings.
      This film does not do anything new in the genre, but it does provide a window into East Asian culture.
      Many of the Confucianist principles such as filial piety are emphasized.

      Great book, but it drags a little compared to the others in terms of pacing towards the end. Despite this, I still liked it for its dark treatment of the subject matter.
      Unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it was dark in tone like The Two Towers, and it provided a long but rewarding conclusion to a great trilogy.
      Just a wonderful adventure, deep lore, and a world that the reader would like to visit again and again. It's kind of a shame that the main offerings of Middle Earth are this trilogy and The Hobbit.
      I wish J.R.R. Tolkien had other epic stories similar to The Lord of the Rings, but there is always the Silmarillion and The Children of Hurin to keep me satisfied.

      One of the best on the SNES. It is as great as FFVI if not better.
      The music was iconic, the character development was well thought out and each character had weight and importance to the player.
      The idea of a time traveling antagonist is genius. We've seen this trope more in Japanese culture, but in American films, this trope is very rare, making it feel novel.
      Lavos is one of the best villains ever. It does not say a word, but it had presence.
      In terms of depth, it is not as deep as FFVI, but I think that was perfectly fine because there was no grinding involved.
      The game mechanics accomplished their goal and a great story was told.
      The addition of the FMV's and multiple endings was much appreciated.
      Definitely a game everyone should play once in their lives.

      This ends my foray into Disney's 2d animation. I don't have much to say about this one other than that it seems to embody everything that Disney represents as a brand.
      Stylistically, it is very similar to Snow Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but unlike that film, there are great lessons that everyone can take away from this film.

      The second entry in the Lord of the Rings. A really great read that expands on characters in a way the movies just couldn't.
      The lore is presented in greater detail, and it is just a fine adventure that doesn't get majorly sidetracked.
      Only complaint I have is that sometimes it focuses too much on description instead of the actions of the characters, but this adds to the world building, so it can be easily forgiven.
      From Helms Deep to the Ents to the taming of Smeagol, this book is just consistently high quality. For me, it was better than The Fellowship of the Ring.

  explanation: >
      I am gradually getting convinced that the Disney Renaissance was the best period for 2d animation at Disney.
      Aladdin is unique in that it has a male protagonist.
      It is set within the context of Arabian Nights, and the writers did not shy away from mentioning beheadings and the punishment of cutting off hands for stealing.
      I found that rather interesting given that this is intended for children.
      It is also a film that had celebrity voice actors that knocked it out of the park such as Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried.
      The character design is slightly different from The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, and the animators went for a more flexible slapstick style when it came to movement.
      CGI was also utilized during a time when the technology was still in its infancy.
      This is definitely not a traditional Disney princess film, and it brings a lot of new things to the table.

  explanation: >
      The level of depth in this work is incredible given how accessible the story is.
      It does not use overly sophisticated language, but it still manages to fit in an entire universe worth of lore without coming across as overwhelming.
      Unlike the films, there is a greater emphasis on the hobbits instead of Aragorn which seems appropriate to me because they make more suitable heroes if one is going off of Joseph Campbell's work in The Hero with a Thousand Faces.
      One thing that I noticed here that I did not notice when watching the film was how there seemed to be a strange emphasis on race that borders on racism.
      I don't think this is intentional, but it is noticeable.
      Reading this gave me greater respect for the film.
      There are parts of this that I would have thought were unadaptable, but somehow Peter Jackson managed to make it work.

  explanation: >
      My first Neal Stephenson book. This comes across almost as a steampunk story where the steam is replaced with nanotechnology.
      The oppressed groups are there, and the young child getting abused is also there (although she isn't an orphan).
      Emotionally, this book is kind of stunted, but the world building and detail is on another level.
      The adventures Nell goes on through the Primer are entertaining and offer a hint of what one may consider a decent education to be.
      One complaint I have is that although Neal Stephenson has pages upon pages of great descriptive imagery, his technical descriptions are lacking in rigor.
      Another complaint I have is pacing. The last parts of the novel came quickly and brought no closure.
      I guess maybe the reader is supposed to figure all that out on their own, because the end comes suddenly and mercilessly without allowing the reader a chance to take it in.

      Roger Ebert was part of why I got interested in film and for the longest time, I wanted to watch this film to bring some level of closure in regards to what he was to me.

      The one that started the Disney Renaissance. There are a lot of things this did better than Beauty and the Beast despite the fact that it seemed to suffer in the third act and that it is the older of the two.
      The character design seems better, the score is better, the songs are more memorable, Ariel is a more expressive and more relatable character (for me at least), and I liked Flounder and Sebastian as side characters.
      I think I can say that I liked this one more than Beauty and the Beast during the first half, but I think it lacks in terms of the relationships between characters and character development.

      An undeniably great film from Martin Scorsese. It was filmed in black and white and harkens back to older films from the 40's and 50's with its style.
      There are shots in here that are so original, I honestly don't think I've seen anything similar over my 10+ years of serious/critical film watching.
      The cast is great and Robert Deniro's weight gain to play Jake La Motta in his later years made him almost unrecognizable.
      The changes the characters go through feel real and unforced due to the script.

  explanation: >
      This is a strange book. The meaning of Catch 22 is always changing. Events are told out of order.
      The subject matter is serious, but it is told in a comedic and satiric way.
      Yossarian is probably what any soldier feels like.
      Based on what I've been told, the military is a highly inefficient monster and the experiences of personel is dependent upon the groups you are assigned to.
      Catch 22 seems to emphasize this, and exaggerates it to create a caricature of the U.S. military that is both hilarious and accurate.
      Like in Catch 22, officers are not only underqualified for their jobs, but they obsess over strange things and try to get out of their responsibilities.
      It was an interesting read and I have a positive impression of it, but it is definitely an unorthodox novel.

      The one that started it all is also one of the greatest even when compared to Disney's other works.
      The amount of love and care that was placed into this movie is easy to see.
      For 1937, this level of quality was at least 10 years ahead of its time.
      Snow White has decent screen time, the songs are memorable even though they can get rather technical, and the Dwarves are well thought out.
      For me, this film is neck and neck with Beauty and the Beast.

      Similar to the Hangover, but focuses on highschool and relationships made towards the end of highschool.
      Typical American comedy fare with a raunchy sense of humor.

      This was airing the first time I was in Japan and I never really had the time to watch it until now.
      Shounen sports anime is a highly saturated genre, so it is very rare when a show about men's volleyball raises the bar.
      For this first entry in the series, they focus on the team more than the individual.
      There are those with exceptional talents, but it takes more than one to keep the volleyball from hitting the ground.
      Although there are main characters, everyone is treated with great importance.
      The sport is introduced to viewers who are unfamiliar with the game in a very effective way with all the positions and moves fully explained.
      Sets itself up for the future entries in the series very well.

  explanation: >
      Read the John Dryden translation which emphasized meter and rhyme compared to what may be found in more modern translations.
      The Aeneid almost reads like a fan fiction that somehow ended up improving on the material that served as inspiration.
      Because it is more modern than The Iliad, it has more sophisticated narrative structure.
      One thing that I found to work against The Aeneid was its length.
      Because it was short, many of the characters who were introduced were less memorable than the characters introduced in The Iliad.
      Overall, I found it to be better than the Iliad just because of its sophistication and because it knew how to end.

      Written by Liu Ciuxin and translated by Ken Liu. There are some very well thought out and great concepts presented here.
      Aspects of communication between species separated by light years is covered in detail.
      The concept of a sophon or artificially intelligent proton was mind blowing.
      As a civilization begins to improve in sophistication, its ability to control things at the microlevel and eventually transcend dimensions is an inevitability.
      The way covers the techological advances of the Trisolaris civilization is creative and just on another level.
      The progress of civilization being split between stable and chaotic eras is also a great touch.

      One of the higher rated Disney princess films, but I didn't understand the point of it.
      The fairy godmother showed up out of nowhere.
      The mice and other animals got more screen time than Cinderella.
      Like usual, the animation is well done, and human characters are fluidly animated due to rotoscoping.
      Cinderella is not a character with much depth and is only a vehicle for wish fulfillment unlike Beauty and the Beast.
      The prince is one dimensional here unlike what could be seen in Sleeping Beauty and newer films.

  explanation: >
      About three weeks of intense reading was what it took to make it from one end of this book to the others.
      This is a book that is consistent throughout if you ignore Leo Tolstoy's philosophical musings.
      That said, his philosophical musings and justifications explain the purpose of this novel as well as the greater reasons as to why this novel was written.
      This novel covers everything. The rich, the poor, how war affects all, love, family, life and death.
      I remember thinking about reading this in highschool, but decided not to then because of the character count.
      For those who are intimidated by the more than 500 characters presented in this novel, you'll only need to focus on the main ones.
      Pierre, the Rostov's, the Bolkonsky's and the higher rank figures in the war are really what you'll need to remember.
      I recommend reading this great novel. You might be turned off because of its length, but as you start to dig in, you'll find that it is manageable due to the short chapter lenghts.
      This is a journey you will wish to never end, and luckily, it's so long that it feels like it doesn't.

      A fitting conclusion to a decades worth of world building and story telling.
      Unlike other superhero films, it was not quite as predictable, and it seemed to check all the boxes for what I wanted for the penultimate film of phase 3.
      It had good moments, and it also made callbacks to films that were made earlier in the Marvel universe.
      In terms of scale, it wasn't quite as large as Infinity War, but I think that helped to keep the plot tight and prevent things from getting convoluted.
      I have no complaints. It's not a perfect film, but I think most people will leave theatres satisfied.

      A near perfect Disney animated film. The animation is fluid, and the music is iconic and has survived over the years.

      The fluid animation and vibrant colors from his previous works can be seen here.
      The common themes of the distance between people and what separates them and brings them together is thoroughly explored through the main premise of trading places in dreams.

      There is nothing else like it. The music was conducted by the legendary Leopold Stokowski, and the animation was on point.
      For 1940, this level of fluidity and abstractness in an animation is absolutely mind blowing.
      It's an experience that is unique and difficult to reproduce. It is one thing to film something and set it to music.
      It is another to animate something to music.

      There aren't many shows about running, but this is one of them and it is great.
      This was originally a book before it was adapted to a movie and finally into a show.
      I loved how it covered the personal journeys everyone experiences in running as well as the competitive scene involved in running long distance as a team.
      The soundtrack by Hayashi Yuki was great as well.
      I really need to get my miles in.

  explanation: >
      Watching this before I watch Endgame. Captain Marvel is a movie that tries to do many things. It hits some notes, but it does not hit all of them.
      There are enjoyable moments and moments where where it drags. There are great shots and scenes where the camerawork was not thought out all that well.
      The special effects are impressive as always. The way Samuel L. Jackson was made to look younger was something that I found to be techincally notable.
      I was skeptical of Brie Larson's casting, but she does well in her role as Carol Danvers. Overall, I liked it, but I thought it could have been better.
      My guess is that important scenes had to be edited out for the theatrical cut, because it felt like something was missing.

      Unlike Disney's offerings in the 40's, this felt a lot more polished.
      The animation is beautiful, and I can even see great implementations of rotoscoping in character movement.
      Any shortcomings in animation were successfully compensated by great background work.
      Despite Sleeping Beauty being part of an oversaturated genre, I found it enjoyable, but the characters could have been given more depth.

      Better is a book about the struggles and triumphs of the medical system. He not only covers how medicine and treatment works in the U.S., but also in other countries like India.
      This provides a window into the challenges that are faced by practitioners.
      People sometimes forget that doctors need to worry about malpractice lawsuits and that diagnosis of an illness isn't quite as straight forward as it might seem in media.
      I found the end notes on how to be a positive deviant particularly useful.
      If you are planning on creating a startup that is centered on improving healthcare, understanding a doctor's experience can be very valuable.

      I actually liked it.
      It covered the sensitive topic of growing up very well and managed to do that through Bambi's experiences through the four seasons.
      Unlike Dumbo, this felt quite a bit more polished. You can really tell that it is a product of its time.
      The songs weren't made with commercial success in mind, and the characters weren't created with merchandise on the brain.
      If you were to compare it with The Lion King, you can find some of Bambi's DNA in the Lion King and other succeeding works.

  explanation: >
      It is so cool to watch an interesting concept be implemented so well.
      The actors age as time passes, and it does not feel like the cast is actually acting.
      The time where the characters grew up was the same time I grew up, so I found it very easy to relate.
      Instead of using digital cameras, film was used, and this allowed for the quality of the picture to stay consistent.
      I believe that this should be required viewing for any student of film due to its innovation and execution.

      I'm not sure what to say other than that the series is consistently good and that you can't seem to go wrong with it.
      The second arc of this season was great, but it weakened in the final arcs.
      If you view the series as one continuous story instead of splitting it between seasons, you may find it more enjoyable.
      All Might gets pushed to the limit and the stakes are raised higher and higher as all the characters gain greater skill in their journey to become superheroes.
      It has its ups and downs, but I consider the time spent watching it to be worth it.

  explanation: >
      This book covers quite a bit of ground. It covers the Tarahumara who are exceptionally skilled at long distance running. It covers how central running is to being human.
      It introduces us to the world of ultra marathons, and it also discusses the disadvantages of shoes due to how they restrict our feet and increase the chances of injuries.
      While the writing can come across a little strong due to how it tries to tell a story instead of just present the facts, this also helps to make the read a little more enjoyable.
      What I took away from this is the following: run many miles to become good at running, be consistent, use shoes that does not restrict the toes and provides as flat a surface as possible.

      Kara no Kyoukai was a highly influential work for me, and I am glad that I can finally view the final movie in the series.
      The film covers the nature of the future and how prediction may be a less magical phenomenon than may appear at first glance.
      Like the other movies in the series, due to the achronological nature of the series as a whole, this film manages to not only tell a compelling, thought provoking story, but also provides what can be seen as a great conclusion or continuation of the series.

      I'm not a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's Hollywood films, but this has all the makings of a classic.
      While Paul Verhoeven is unable to do subtlety all that well like usual, this has a story that has enough momentum to avoid stumbling over the mistakes that it might make.
      Camera work and scenes are shot very well. All in all, it is a solid film that displays much of what makes the Dutch people who they are today and offers a good explanation of the resistance movements in the Netherlands during Nazi occupation.

  explanation: >
    Oh boy, I have a lot to say about this one. First, where is my Trojan Horse? I read the Alexander Pope translation which made the read a struggle in the beginning.
    Luckily, I have read The Rape of the Lock before, so I gradually got over the difficult English and began to appreciate the masterful usage of the English language to maintain the poetic qualities of the epic.
    Roman and Greek names are used interchangeably which caused much confusion as well.
    The actual story is bloody, and sometimes nonsensical.
    The gods don't always behave rationally, and sometimes they can be bested in battle by mortals.
    The fact that Achilles pretty much singlehandedly turned the tide of battle towards the later part of the story made for a very strangely paced work.
    There are many characters and not all of them are introduced. You really need to read the rest of the Epic Cycle to truly gain a proper understanding of what is going on.
    Overall, it is great for a poem spread through oral tradition, but as an actual story, I found it lacking by modern standards. If you want something better, I recommend Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Mahabharata.

      My journey into the world of Disney 2d Animated films begins with Dumbo.
      For 1941, the work is impressive, but an experienced viewer will notice that the animators were focused mainly on the animation and music.
      The sound design and the story were not given as much attention. Not all movements by the animated characters have a sound, and because the story was simple enough, there was not as much effort placed there.
      I couldn't figure out if the crows at the end were a racist caricature or not. It seems like others have mixed opinions about them as well.

      A highly underrated film.
      This was created during a time when backgrounds and animations were carefully drawn by hand and technology did not allow as many shortcuts as they do now.
      While they could have gone for spectacle like many other Japanese animated films during the time, this work carefully navigates many topics such as the cold war, class warfare, and religion and frames those topics within the context of space travel.
      The storytelling is its strong point, but the animation and the score are able to stand up as prime examples of their medium.

      I find it strange that thousands of years in the future, we will have space faring monarchies, and that nuclear power will by the prime method of generating energy.
      In addition to this, I find it unrealistic that we would still be humanoids and struggle with many of the things we struggle with now.
      If one were to ignore all this, it does have the workings of a great political drama that takes place in space.

      I was avoiding the last episode for a decent amount of time and it did not disappoint with the brutal amount of emotional weight it dumped on me.
      Made in Abyss might appear accessible to children on first glance, but this is a series that is mercilessly realistic in regards to the unforgiving nature of the world.
      To summarize Made in Abyss in a single sentence: two children journey to the depths of hell. The story is shown as an adventure into the abyss in search of the truth.
      With solid world building, this series beautifully displays the hero's journey in its entirety-- good parts and bad.
      Watching this reminded me of many greater works I have read in the past as well as historical tragedies: Dante's Inferno, Nietzsche, human experimentation during the Holocaust, and Grimm's Fairy Tales.
      The deep themes combined with Kevin Penkin's sophisticated score made this a very impactful story for me.

  explanation: >
      Juno was surprising in that it had an overqualified cast and a script that is great during most of the film (although sometimes it does feel like it is trying too hard at times).
      The delivery of dialogue is quick and deadly. Camera work is above mediocre.
      I'm not sure if the film was trying to be hip or come across as quirky, but this sometimes backfires when it takes away from the emotional punch that can be delivered by the situation of unexpected teen pregnancy.
      Despite all this, I don't think that there is any other film like it and because of the short runtime, there isn't much to lose if the film doesn't connect.

      On its own merits, I don't see what the big deal is. Half Life 2 was a better game.
      What this game did have going for it was good level design.
      Story-wise, it was better than other games during the time, but it's nothing to write home about.
      While the player is given multiple weapons, they don't really add any new mechanics to the gameplay.

      A classy noir film that is very similar to L.A. Confidential, L.A. Noir and The Maltese Falcon.

      I don't understand why, but 1970's films seem to have been more willing to take darker and more depressing turns compared to previous decades.
      This increase in realism allows for an easier suspension of disbelief and a smoother film to follow from the perspective of the viewer.

      I don't think I have ever seen a movie like this.
      This movie follows the story of Frank Abagnale and his adventures posing as different people while forging millions of dollars worth of checks.
      Bank fraud is something that I never would have thought was interesting, but somehow, Spielberg managed to spin this into a thrilling character study.
      Very fun to watch.

      This was an interesting read due to many companies adopting the practices that Google has-- my company included.
      In many companies, the creative element needed to introduce interesting new products tends to be stifled, and in most they are not fostered.
      While it is unclear whether Google's approach is the best, what is clear is that the company takes risks and is more fluid than most companies of its size.
      Due to this, it manages to act as an example that helps to disprove many commonly held beliefs about how a company needs to be run to achieve success.

  explanation: >
      I am starting to view movies not just based on critical acclaim, but also keeping cultural impact in mind.
      Mean girls is a movie that has had great impact on modern American culture.
      Going into this, I was expecting it to be more family friendly, but the contents are suprisingly mature given the high school setting.
      In many ways, this movie is very similar to Easy A, but it focuses more on highschool cliques than on just popularity.
      I think Easy A is the better movie, but both are close in quality.
      The only major problem with Mean Girls I can think of is that it feels somewhat dated with cliques and types that have gone extinct in the 2000's.

      Think and Grow Rich emphasizes the importance of mindset and how it leads everything and can ultimately lead to success.
      Although Napoleon Hill has not accomplished much himself, this book and the modern edits has some useful information.
      It also showed me how similar many self-help books are.

      I feel conflicted about this book.
      While I do agree that the American education system does not teach the right things, I feel like this book does not either.
      Advice can be vague and sometimes even counterproductive. An example of this is Robert Kiyosaki's praising of multi-level marketing.
      In many ways, it reads very similarly to The Art of the Deal, and does not provide enough concrete action items to work from.
      I agree that financial education should be more important. I agree that you shouldn't work for your money and that your money should work for you.
      However, the contents of this book felt more like a sales pitch for a class than something that people can use.

      I think the last time I found myself with a deep sense of saudade with a video game was after finishing the Mass Effect series about three years ago.
      That was exactly how I felt when I saw the credits roll the end of FFVI.
      From beginning to end, the game had something to offer in the form of a great story, and memorable characters.
      Because of this, I was sad to see it end. The game had great pacing, kept the grinding to a minimum, and was filled with worlds of exploration.
      It was ambitious, not only in its story, but in its refusal to center itself on a main character.
      Each character was given care and attention which made the payoff at the end all the more worth the hours poured in by the player.
      The creators knew exactly what they were doing when they named you the player as one of the characters in this SNES epic.

      This took about 4-5 months to complete and after finishing it, there are areas that I find to be shaky.
      This isn't all that surprising considering that the math involved is difficult to conceptually understand.
      That said, I find it fascinating that the primary building blocks of linear algebra are the skills that we build in Algebra 1.
      By completing this, I improved my understanding of matrices, vectors, and alternate coordinate bases.

      This film did not have the greatest start, but picked up in quality as we started getting into the meat of the story.
      Dallas Buyers Club takes place in Texas during the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and follows the story of Ron Woodroof who worked to get medication to help AIDS patients when treatments were still in development in the U.S..
      While it may not be historically accurate, it manages to capture the tragic nature of living with AIDS with the great acting.

      Violet Evergarden is a series focused on the intentions infused into letters.
      The creators handle this subject matter with an appropriate amount of sensitivity through the fluidity and detail in the animation.
      Episodes cover the topic in a simple manner by focusing on the writer, the recipients, the process of writing, delivery, and how the letters are affected by the times in which they are written.
      In addition to this, the usage of letters as a motif that is used as an engine for character development is nothing short of masterful.
      In this day and age where physical letters are becoming more rare, this show manages to remind us of how humans can connect with one another.

      This book introduces readers to the world of competitive memorization and some of the techniques one can use to remember things better.
      It covers in decent depth what memory is and what role it plays in our lives as well as the history of mnemonic technique.
      In addition to this, it also covers Joshua Foer's journey into the world of competitive memorization.
      While the book may read like a long article in a newspaper or magazine, it has useful information.
      Unfortunately, it is not an instructional guide to memorization and should not be treated as such.
      If you want to improve your mnemonic techniques, I recommend reading this book to introduce yourself to the world of memorization and then researching and practicing techniques on your own.

  explanation: >
      Aliens feels like what you would get if you crossed the original Alien with Die Hard and then scaled everything up.
      Although Aliens is more of an action film than sci-fi horror, James Cameron manages to keep much of what made the previous film great by only turning up the action in the second half of the film.
      For the first half, we don't see a single alien, and this allows for the maintaining of suspense as well as foreshadowing.
      While I prefer the original Alien because I prefer Ridley Scott's sensibilities, Aliens not only manages to match Alien in certain areas, but also manages to improve over Alien through its own unique qualities.

      There are not many films that take place in Antarctica, and there are even fewer that can take advantage of the setting in the way The Thing did.

      The special effects were impressive, and it is easy to see why this film influenced many horror directors as well as many Japanese directors such as Hideo Kojima and Takashi Miike.

      After reading The Lean Startup, I found myself questioning how in the world Theranos could survive for as long as it did.
      I suppose that proves how important the pitch and connections are. That said, it seemed like they did everything wrong except for PR and marketing.
      The executives did not listen to the engineers that worked on the testing machines, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani lied to investors and customers, the culture was toxic, and the concept of an mvp was completely foreign.

      The series continues with quality that is consistent with previous seasons and arguably hits notes that have not been hit before in previous seasons.
      The focus this time around is not on what lies outside of the walls, but rather what lies within.
      The third season plays more like a political thriller and as a result is able to provide exposition about the kingdom with nuance instead of through more heavy handed methods.
      A pattern a keen viewer might notice is that the director is gradually cycling through the six types of conflict in literature. In previous seasons, man vs. nature and man vs. man was covered thoroughly.
      This season focuses on man vs. society and man vs. self. If the previews of season 3 part 2 are anything to go by, we will soon seen man vs. technology and perhaps man vs. the supernatural make an appearance.
      I am looking forward to the next part and am curious to see how the work is concluded.

  explanation: >
      For anyone who has seen episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, you will be familiar with his playfulness with the plot to create suspense.
      I enjoyed Psycho more than I enjoyed Vertigo, and I wonder if it is the better film. Everyone played their roles perfectly, and Anthony Perkins was the main attraction.
      The way this movie is structured is not only smart, but contrarian and subversive. There are not many films that kill off the main character half way through the film.
      I imagine audiences during the time were caught off guard, expecting what is perhaps a crime drama, only to find that it was something closer to a psychological thriller.
      It is comes to no surprise that this influenced many directors in the succeeding generation.

  explanation: >
      I remember the usage of proxy wars by PMC's within Metal Gear Solid 4 as a strong plot device, and wondered why the U.S. military was not as privatized when contractors were used to deliver products and services to be used by the military.
      Not surprisingly, there were more contractors in Afghanistan starting in 2007 than there were U.S. forces. Yet, for some reason, this information is covered in detail in the news or by the U.S. government.
      This video on the evolution of PMC's shows how they have played a larger and larger role in conflicts on the global scale. I not would be surprised if PMC's disrupt government militaries in the future by not only performing better, but working more efficiently without a large bureaucracy.
      While the concept may be troubling, I think it's only a matter of time for PMC's to do to the military what Space X has begun to do to NASA and ROSCOSMOS.

  explanation: >
      This is a hard, time consuming read that is dense with ideas. The book introduces us to System 1 and System 2 which are the two systems that govern how how thinking and brain power is allocated.
      These two systems are used as the basis of explaining many of the insufficiencies of the human mind. Topics such as the limitations of intuition, inability to maximize utility, and the superseding of rational thought by emotional reactions are covered.
      While the book may read like a textbook, it is very thought provoking. The implications extend to all aspects of our society and may explain why certain policies are favored in government, why one interview candidate was chosen over the other, even if the other choice is objectively better than what was ultimately chosen.

      Given the time this film was made, the director definitely had the choice of using color, but chose to use black and white. I feel that this was the correct decision.
      After reading the book, I watched the film. While the film cuts out characters and many details in the source materials, I felt that it managed to faithfully capture the spirit of the book.
      Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch was perfect.

      A series of interconnected stories about different people stuggling with different psychological disorders and mental illnesses with the only constant being Dr. Irabu the psychiatrist.
      The show uses a combination of different animation techniques such as rotoscoping and live action to better show many of the abstract thoughts the creators wished to convey and to better educate about the disorders including the outlining of any artistic licenses that have been taken.
      The experimental approach to the topics covered is growing more rare in the animation industry in Japan, but the care given to the work reinforces the case for greater risks to be taken in animation.
      Because many of the cases are specific to Japan, the show also manages to touch upon the collective unconcious of the country. I think Carl Jung would be proud.

      A text based browser game that tells a story through the environment that it builds rather than through expositions.
      Through its simplicity, it is able to keep the player's attention by incrementally building off of the mechanics that it gradually introduces.
      This can be said to be one of the precursors to the increase in html5 based browser games we see today.
      I think it would be interesting to create a browser game myself in the future.

      Also watched the game which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/cUTMhmVh1qs" target="_blank">here</a>.
      I felt like I had deja vu watching this, because, like the Lee Sedol vs Alphago games, I did not have a full understanding of the rules of the games.
      That said, it was exciting to watch just like the alphago games. This time, Deepmind set their sights on Starcraft II.
      What I found interesting about the AI was that it did not have as high of an APM as the pro players. It seemed to deliberately choose its actions.
      This most likely indicates that the pro players have many redundant actions.
      My guess is that the AI noticed patterns within the game that humans have overlooked.
      I recommend reading Deepmind's blog post about the event <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/" target="_blank">here</a>.

  explanation: >
      It's a sin to kill a mockingbird. I have never read this novel before, and after reading it, I can understand why it is part of many high school curriculums.
      While, many focus on its coverage of the treatment of African Americans during the depression era, the novel is a coming of age story at its heart that shows how nonsensical the world can be through a child's eyes.
      I found many of the characters to be convincing and well thought out. This was particularly the case with Atticus Finch who is shown to be a rare example of a principled man in a town with racist tendencies.
      I intend to watch the film in the near future.

      A highly educational series about the workings of the body that is very much in the vein of works such as Fantastic Voyage and Osmosis Jones.
      The details are highly accurate, making the series a useful tool for learning about microbiology and immunology.
      The series covers topics such as allergic reactions, food poisoning, and other inner body events that require an immune response.
      In terms of narrative, it is not the strongest, but within its genre, it is probably one of the best and makes what is usually a dry topic very interesting.
      I recommend supplementing your viewing with Dr. Hope's Sick Notes commentary of the individual episodes.

      I remember reading the book as a child, so seeing the movie was a joy for me.
      The film adds to the source material with clever writing, great stop motion animation, and many of the quirks Wes Anderson is famous for.
      The voice acting by George Clooney and Meryl Streep suited the characters very well and added traits to the characters that was not described in the book.
      Because of the sophisticated writing, I feel that adults will enjoy this more than children.

      During Freshman orientation at U of M, this film and Moonrise Kingdom were playing.
      I chose to watch Moonrise Kingdom and always wanted to view this film afterwards, but never got the chance until now.
      Headhunters is a skillfully crafted thriller that effortlessly plays with suspense.
      The story covers an art thief who is on the run from the owner of one of the art pieces he stole: an above average cat and mouse thriller.
      While it never touches on any heavy themes, its pace makes it so that it never bores.

      This is the first time I've viewed any of Osamu Hayashi's work. Japan has a constant focus on work, and the debt one owes society.
      However, in many cases, this can remove meaning from one's existence within society.
      Here, Hayashi Sensei discusses with many Neets who have performed well academically what it means to have a job, and why it is unreasonable to always expect for society to conform to your wishes.
      He also explores the topics within the context of his own life experiences and clearly outlines the differences between what one wants to do in life and what what can do in life.
      The conversation is nuanced and touches upon many different subjects and offers meaning to aspects of life that are usually never explored in depth in Japanese society.
      If you understand Japanese, I recommend taking 30 min out of your day to view this video.

      Siddhartha is written in a lyrical style and reads very similarly to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.
      One of the main themes of the novel is that wisdom cannot be taught, but that it must be gained through experience.
      The usage of Siddhartha as a foil to Gautama's philosophy offers nuance that can provide greater insight into what Samsara and Nirvana is.
      While it may come across as simplistic, I felt that the simple writing style allowed for better introspection.

      Great film and very well written. It's rated PG, but I have no idea why. Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw stole the show.
      Each of the characters were carefully considered and have unique qualities that make them memorable.

  explanation: >
      The book is split into two parts. The first covers Viktor Frankl's time in the German concentration camps and the second covers logotherapy.
      The usage of Viktor Frankl's experience during the Holocaust to explain the significance of meaning was very powerful.
      I found logotherapy to be a more rational approach to psychotherapy and finding meaning to life than other approaches, but it does seem dated.
      A more modern approach might utilize statistics and mathematics to clearly outline patterns in human behavior.
      Overall, the way this work outlined purpose, the will to live, and the various perspectives by which to view suffering made it a useful read.

      An introduction to Wim Hof and the power of his breathing technique.
      I also recommend watching his talks with Joe Rogan and his recent appearance on Impact Theory.
      Using hypoxia to improve mental and bodily tolerances is something that I have never tried before, and the amount of added control it provides to the body makes it seem like a very valuable skill that is very similar to that which is exhibited by Shaolin monks.
      Wim Hof's insistence on taking rigorous metrics and scientifically analyzing everything has expelled any doubts that his technique can allow for the human body to overcome various limits.

  explanation: >
      This was not an easy book to read due to my ignorance about Russian culture and history.
      That said, the plight of Raskolnikov was not only relatable, but it can be observed in one form or another in the lives of people today.
      Because of this, the philosophical underpinnings were not lost in translation or lost to time.
      The organization of the book may seem strange to some, because it switches its focus to its side characters frequently.
      While this may be interpretted as a flaw in the novel, the treatment of the Marmeladovs and Svidrigailov gives us a more complete study of human behavior that may not be exhibited by Raskolnikov.
      Dostoyevsky added an epilogue at the end. This, in my opinion, weakened the ending, and I recommend thoroughly skipping it.

      A conversation with Ben Goertzel the founder of SingularityNET. Unlike other AI researchers, Ben does not seem quite as dismissive of ideas that have originated in science fiction and Hollywood movies.
      As a result, the conversation reaches areas that may not be covered by other individuals who work in the field.
      One interesting thing that Ben noted during the conversation is that the apocalypse scenario with AI seems to originate in western culture and does not seem to be recognized as much of a problem in East Asia.

      Even if you aren't a fan of the source material, I feel that there is a lesson for everyone to take away from this movie.
      Although this is missing characters like Silk, Anya, and Jessica Drew, I think their exclusion worked to the benefit of the film by preventing things from getting too complicated.

      My first Walter Isaacson biography. It covers Benjamin Franklin's life from beginning to end.
      I found that I learned quite a bit about colonial and post independence America that I did not learn in grade school.
      In school, our knowledge tends to be very America specific, so global events, France's involvement and Canada are covered in very little detail if any.
      I also found the tips and tricks that Benjamin Franklin developped in regards to work to be very useful. Overall, I learned that Franklin's achievements extend past his actions during America's Revolutionary war.
      Not only was he a politician, but he was a scientist, a printer, and a well rounded person who influenced many things we take for granted today.

      The electric skates in the simulation are gone and replaced with a set of wheels that are attached to a Tesla.
      The tunnel itself was disappointing, but the highlight of the show is the many-fold gains made in tunneling and boring technology.

  explanation: >
      It seems like many of the works I've been consuming lately deals with life and death. Daytripper is a work that has a unique device where the main character dies at the end of each issue during different points in his life.
      Daytripper not only discusses the important life changing moments that can result in the rebirth of one's identity, but also the fact that everyone will die. In many cases, it treads similar ground as Siddhartha Gautama, but it offers a more personal and modern touch that may make it easier to relate to.

  explanation: >
      I think this is the first Swedish film I have ever seen. Although this film is not fast paced, it does not drag on and moves from scene to scene with purpose.
      Themes of Death and God are tackled in this film and are handled very well. Even though it is in black and white, images have staying power and are carefully thought out.
      In many ways, it makes me feel like it is an older version of Death Parade and may actually be one of the sources of inspiration that Death Parade drew from.

  explanation: >
      This video from VICE begins with a demonstration of what a malicious attacker is capable of when they take advantage of vulnerabilities in a self driving car.
      We live in a time where cybersecurity is growing in importance. Israel and it's military and private institutions are growing and attaining global dominance in these areas.
      Usually, we think of the U.S., Russia, China, and the U.K.'s GCHQ as the giants in the security arena. Now, it must be acknowledged that Israel is a powerful force in intelligence and cyber warfare.
      Recently, we've seen glimpses of Israel's power in Snowden's files, and Harvey Weinsteins' hiring of Black Cube. With the growth of private companies in Israel, I expect the frequency of Israeli firms in the news to only increase.

  explanation: >
      A soft introduction into deep learning in the context of self driving cars. This is a class that is led by Lex Fridman. I found this to be highly interesting.
      It includes talks by people in the industry and not only covers the technical aspects of the field, but also how policy and business is changing to accomodate the changes.
      Also includes a very simple example that helped me better understand how gradient descent and backpropogation works. You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/nFTQ7kHQWtc?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

  explanation: >
      A film that I was told should be required viewing for any office worker. It wasn't as funny as I expected it to be, but I enjoyed it all the same. I found that it did not connect as well because it takes place in the late 90's. That could just be the effect of a generational gap.
      That said, I think most people who have worked white collar jobs will find something in here that they will like. I'm honestly quite surprised that the critical response is not higher.

  explanation: >
      A book that covers the Nanking Massacre in great detail. The novel is split into three parts that details the event from the perspective of the Chinese, the Japanese, and foreigners that were in Nanking during the time.
      The contents of this book were heavy, and the descriptions of many of the war crimes that occured were difficult to stomach. Iris Chang wrote a compelling book, and it is unfortunate that she committed suicide. This book is not easy reading, but I feel that it is something that should be read so that we never forget what occurred.

  explanation: >
      Available on Gutenberg. This is a translation of the Lao Tzu's work. The Tao or the Dao is often contradictory and this is to be expected because of the inherent nature of yin and yang in the Taiji.
      In many cases, the teachings seem like common sense, but in some, the messages can seem cryptic or often unintuitive. For those who are unfamiliar with eastern philosophy, this can be difficult to conceptually grasp.
      One thing that I found interesting was that I could see some of concepts that would later show up in Confucianism. Concepts such as humility which are very common in east Asian cultures can be found here.

      12 rules for making more sense of the world. This was intended to be a more accessible version of Maps of Meaning, but I found that this read less like a helpful guide and more like a series of essays. References to the Bible were thorough and used to explain points, but I found them to detract from the lessons being covered.
      The book is well written, but overly long. My impression of the book is mixed. I recommend listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures instead.

      A film that may not appeal to everyone. It's a slow moving, but stylistic and beautiful film. Shots are well constructed and thoughtfully paced. It's scarce on plot, but high on artistry.

      Snipes Battle of the Year has been getting greater and greater attention over the years. This year, the heavy hitters were Jinjo Crew, Foundnation, and the Vagabonds crew. Because Jinjo had Wing and Hong10, they pretty much demolished the competition all the way to the finals.

  explanation: >
      A work of art that I believe should deserve more attention. There are not many works that cover topics such as heaven and hell as well as life and death. The emphasis on the void and reincarnation diverges from the traditional themes of good and evil that can be found in monotheistic religion.
      As a result, a more nuanced interpretation of the topics is provided in the show. This is a show that I believe can appeal to a critic's sensibility as well as to the mainstream. Every detail seems purposeful and well thought out.
      In my opinion, this is the best anime I've seen so far this year.

      The first season was what got me started with my current routine of waking up at 4:30 and going to the gym. So, I have a bit of attachment to this series.

      I played through the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection in Japanese, Ground Zeros on PS4 and The Phantom Pain on ps3.
      Because of that, I thought it would be strange for me to play this last. Despite this, I found MGS to be one of the best in the series and thoroughly enjoyable despite its age.
      The care given to Sniper Wolf made her one of my most favorite characters in the series. Although I played the integral version, I think the game should play well on any console because of the simple controls.
      This is a cinematic game that I think anyone will be able to enjoy.

      Multivariable Calculus for Khan Academy. Covers topics such as partial derivatives, gradients, curl, divergence, triple integrals, line integrals, etc.
      Not all of the content has been committed to long term memory, but important concepts like a partial and a gradient have stuck. One thing I underestimated was how much of a time suck this would be. Each video is about 10-15 minutes.

      Scalable and accurate simulation of light within a virtual environment. If the technology continues at the same pace, we'll hopefully have photorealistic computer graphics in films within 5 years and the same for video games within 10-15 years.
      This will allow for the immersive nature of VR and AR to increase tremendously. Now, all we need are sophisticated haptic feedback systems or neural links to allow for better interaction with the virtual environments.
      That said, I would have liked to have seen some info about graphics cards for consumers.

      Played this in English. Many people view this title with nostalgia. Although this is a solid turn based rpg, I didn't feel that it aged well.
      Compared to other 3d titles, the visuals were not the best and took away from the depth offered by the combat system and detailed story. I can see why this is being remade.

      This was recommended to me by the instructor of a creative writing course that I took while I was in university. I put off watching this for a while, and I regret doing so. Brie Larson was great, but the star of the film was Jacob Tremblay. His performance was probably the best I've ever seen out of a child actor. The film captures the relationship between mother and son with great care. Although the story can be emotionally heavy, I recommend it for multiple viewings.

      A bit on the long side, but Daniel Day-Lewis's acting manages to keep the story from ever getting dull. It's not the best movie that Steven Spielberg directed, but it is still a great film that can be used as reference in regards to learning what makes a good leader.

      In this sequel, the budget is higher and the jokes are more expensive. Deadpool is no longer something new, so it is interesting to see how they try to keep him fresh.

      Watched in Imax. A film that is the culmination of three phases of films in the Marvel cinematic universe.
      Although it may be lacking in story, it more than makes up for it with its scale and the ambitious plot that brings together all of the characters in the marvel universe.
      In addition to this, it finally brings Thanos to the forefront and provides him with greater depth than he had in the comics. I saw the first Avengers film when I was in high school, so the payoff was particularly rewarding to me.

      A film that offers subtle commentary on race relations. If you were to ignore the undertones, you will find that it is still a solid horror film.
      There are many details hidden throughout, so I recommend multiple viewings.

      Damien Chazelle delivers just like he did in Whiplash. The songs are catchy and they stick in your head days after you finish the movie.
      Gosling's piano skills were extremely impressive and the absence of a hand double only added to its quality.

      An interesting documentary about the cartoonist Robert Crumb.
      Although it wasn't my cup of tea, I appreciated the how deeply the cartoonist's past and his relationship with his family was explored.

      The most refined show in the series in my opinion. The Eurobeat and the adrenaline pumping action does not let up. In addition to this, technical aspects of the mechanics of car racing are also covered in depth.

      One of the most memorable events of the year. I never thought the rocket would successfully take off. The climax was the simultaneous landing of the side boosters.
      It would have been nice to see the center core land on the droneship, but 2/3 is still great. The shot of starman floating off into space was a good touch.
      Space x's have been continuously getting better over the years and this launch proved that they could not only nail the launch, but the telemetry as well.

      Saw this in imax. Great film. Although this was not my favorite Nolan film, it easily is one of the most well made among his works.
      The shots of the fighter planes were the most technical and impressive scenes in the film. Hans Zimmer's usage of the Shepard's tone could have been more emphasized.
      I actually did not realize that a Shepard's tone was used until looking it up after the fact. Because of how drawn out the auditory illusion was, in many cases, it felt as if the effect of the illusion was diminished.

      Menno wins again. There are some great battles in here, but it didn't feel all that satisfying. On the bright side, it did showcase the Netherland's hip hop culture which was great to see.

      Saw this in imax. An underrated film; just as great as the first. Probably the best experience I've had watching a film in a movie theatre. The custom Imax intro was a nice touch.
      The sound engineering was incredible and allowed for the audience to feel the sound instead of simply hearing it. This is a movie that sticks in your head days after you see it.

      Introduction of Musk's plans to reach Mars. This was why Space X was created and it is great to see an actual system that has been designed to reach that goal in a realistic way.
