    For the first time in my experience as a masters student, I scored the highest in a course out of about 80 people.

    Through some miracle, I actually managed to pass all of my resits.
    This is good, but I don't feel much of a sense of accomplishment and this seems to complicate whether I should continue with the program or not.
    I intend to treat this as an optimal stopping problem and make a decision after I have completed 37% of the program.

    My work ethic has reached an extreme over the past week or so.
    My time is spent mainly studying.
    I only spend about 4-8 hours to take a break in a single week.
    This is despite the fact that the CS program should ideally only consume 42 hours of my time in a week.
    When I wake up, I usually think about school.
    I currently don't have much of a social life.
    Sleep isn't that great either because I can't stop thinking about school and the sun rarely comes out in the Netherlands.
    I'm not sure what the solution to this is, but I'll continue documenting status as things progress.
    Generally speaking, it is highly discouraging when all of the work you put in does not pay off in any way.
    On the positive side of things, I'm getting rather proficient in Latex.

    Received passing grades for the remaining 2 exams.
    2/4 is not great, but the statistics at least shows that I'm not the dumbest person on the campus or in my faculty which is promising.
    How I proceed from here will depend on how I learn to handle stress, manage the classes for Q2 and how I handle resits.
    So far, things do not look promising.

    Completed second exam for the first quarter of the Computer Science graduate program at TU Delft.
    Having second thoughts about the program.
    Guitar playing skills are degrading rapidly due to no instrument to practice with and very little time for practicing.
    I don't think I can shred anymore.
    I am also losing a fair amount of weight due to stress and lack of high intensity exercise.
    The lack of meat in the European diet is not helping either.
    It is highly likely that I will need to do more than one resit for this quarter.
    On the flip side, I am learning a lot, and have met a fair number of people.
    In some ways, I am gaining something from the program despite questionable academic performance.
    There are some things I have noticed.
    It has been many years since I have taken an exam in an academic setting and I need to be able to handle psychological pressure during an exam to minimize mistakes.
    Due to my below average memory, I require more repetition which requires more time to place items into long term memory.
    If I want to be able to succeed, I not only need to better manage time, but I will also need to find a more efficient way of studying.
    My level of mathematics is not up to par and it has been many years since I have attended a math course.
    This has forced me to learn entire classes worth of information to keep up with classes in the program.
    There is not much I can do about this other than try to catch up, because this information was not disclosed to me before admission.
    Due to the mathematical nature of the classes at TU Delft, my years of experience in the professional world has been mostly useless outside of team related activities.
    I plan to continue to forge forward, but if outlook does not improve, I may seriously consider leaving the program after the third quarter.
    This will ensure that I at least leave with a decent understanding of deep learning.

    Memorized 1000 Dutch words.
    Memorization was accelerated through the use of Memrise.
    In the past, I used Anki, but Anki has limitations when trying to associate sound with a flash card.
    I can make out simple conversations, but I have trouble understanding Dutch due to my ears not being used to the speed at which people talk.

    Run 4 km while carrying 30 pounds. There are a few things to note about wearing a weight vest while running.
    In addition to requiring higher strength when running, a weight vest can also restrict your breathing, making it difficult to utilize lower lung breathing.
    Wearing a weight vest is more about pain tolerance than stamina.

    Highly recommended for improving pain tolerance and mindset.
