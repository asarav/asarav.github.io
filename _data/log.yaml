    Completed second exam for the first quarter of the Computer Science graduate program at TU Delft.
    Having second thoughts about the program.
    Guitar playing skills are degrading rapidly due to no instrument to practice with and very little time for practicing.
    I don't think I can shred anymore.
    I am also losing a fair amount of weight due to stress and lack of high intensity exercise.
    The lack of meat in the European diet is not helping either.
    It is highly likely that I will need to do more than one resit for this quarter.
    On the flip side, I am learning a lot, and have met a fair number of people.
    In some ways, I am gaining something from the program despite questionable academic performance.
    There are some things I have noticed.
    It has been many years since I have taken an exam in an academic setting and I need to be able to handle psychological pressure during an exam to minimize mistakes.
    Due to my below average memory, I require more repetition which requires more time to place items into long term memory.
    If I want to be able to succeed, I not only need to better manage time, but I will also need to find a more efficient way of studying.
    My level of mathematics is not up to par and it has been many years since I have attended a math course.
    This has forced me to learn entire classes worth of information to keep up with classes in the program.
    There is not much I can do about this other than try to catch up, because this information was not disclosed to me before admission.
    Due to the mathematical nature of the classes at TU Delft, my years of experience in the professional world has been mostly useless outside of team related activities.
    I plan to continue to forge forward, but if outlook does not improve, I may seriously consider leaving the program after the third quarter.
    This will ensure that I at least leave with a decent understanding of deep learning.

    Memorized 1000 Dutch words.
    Memorization was accelerated through the use of Memrise.
    In the past, I used Anki, but Anki has limitations when trying to associate sound with a flash card.
    I can make out simple conversations, but I have trouble understanding Dutch due to my ears not being used to the speed at which people talk.

    Run 4 km while carrying 30 pounds. There are a few things to note about wearing a weight vest while running.
    In addition to requiring higher strength when running, a weight vest can also restrict your breathing, making it difficult to utilize lower lung breathing.
    Wearing a weight vest is more about pain tolerance than stamina.

    Ran 5 miles at once which is the longest distance I have traveled at a running pace. Distance was covered at Island Lake State Recreation Area.
    I wore flat minimalist shoes with little cushioning if any. Afterwards, I had pain in my toes and trouble going down stairs due to difficulty bending my left knee.
    I intend to run again in one week.

    Will be cutting down on time spent coding for the website and other projects and will be focusing on other efforts such as writing, exercise, and beginning long distance running.

    Jumped out of a plane. Jumped out at 14,000 feet above ground in tandem and spent about 50 seconds in freefall before the parachute was released.

    Endured extreme cold temperatures in shorts and a short sleeve shirt.
    Utilized the Wim Hof method for 10 minutes in 13.4 degrees Fahrenheit weather.
    I started losing feeling in my toes towards the end, but did not suffer any negative consequences.
    Highly recommended for improving pain tolerance and mindset.
