            <p>My freshman year of undergrad, I was involved in the Lloyd Hall Scholars program so that I could focus on some of my more artistic interests.
            I initially entered the Ross School of Business with the intention of completing a BBA with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Japanese language before switching to focus mainly on Computer Science and Japanese.</p>
            <p>During the entirety of my time as a undergraduate student, I was a member of Circle K.</p>

                My team was responsible for OnBalance which is the company's cloud based web product for small and medium businesses.

            <p>To explore more advanced concepts like AI, ML, and to gain new experiences, I began studying at TU Delft.
            Of the time of attending TU Delft was ranked in the top 60's for computer science worldwide and is the top university in the Netherlands for many technical fields.
            This also marks my first time in Europe.
            My thesis work focuses on the use of conversational agents situated within a diet based context for patients with type II diabetes that utilizes shared experiences to enhance goal achievement.
            The primary areas of computer science this touches upon are AI, ML, NLP, Embodied Conversational Agents (CA), and Socio-cognitive Engineering (SCE).

                <p> Film has always been my first love ever since high school.
                    Although my interest has slightly waned after the death of Roger Ebert, I still try to stay up to date on the more popular and critically acclaimed films that are released every year.
                    My favorite directors are Kubrick, Nolan, Sergio Leone, and Mamoru Oshii. Recently, Denis Villeneuve has been getting close to making his way into that list.</p>

                <p> I started learning Japanese in high school and continued in college.
                    I originally started because of an interest in the culture and anime, but this eventually developed into a need to understand foreign markets and global relations.
                    After my internship in Hikone, I received N2 Certification in the JLPT in 2014 which requires the ability to identify about 1000+ Chinese characters.
                    I am capable of reading manga and light novels.
                    Because of the nature of my previous work experiences, I actually find technical discussions easier to navigate than casual conversations.
                    I am also capable of phoenetically reading Hangul due to a semester of Korean language that I took as an undergraduate.
                    Currently, I am in the process of learning Dutch and am probably at about A1 level.
                    Statistics for other languages not mentioned (as of Feb 21, 2021): Mandarin Chinese (362 words), Spanish (200 words), Italian (198 words), Tamil (115 words).
                    If I have (a lot of) time, I would like to have multi-language support on this website for all of the languages I speak.

                <div class="heading">Guitar</div>
                <p> I started taking guitar seriously around the time when I started attending university as an undergraduate.
                    Initially, I just wanted to be able to play  songs competently, but as I progressed and learned more advanced techniques, my approach became more technical.
                    I play a neoclassical style and focus mainly on complex tapping licks. That said, I can also sweep and shred.
                    For some reason, I use economy picking on the way down, and alternate picking on the way up. I'm not entirely sure when I started doing this.
                    My main influences are Buckethead, Shawn Lane, Paul Gilbert, and Yngwie Malmsteen.
                    My first guitar was a squire bullet. When I was working at Perficient I also played a squire bullet for the internship period. I then upgraded to an ESP LTD model with a floyd rose.
                    When I was working in Hikone, I played an Aria Magna. After that, I got a used Ernie Ball John Petrucci signature series. When I was working for Sony, I played an Ibanez Gio for the internship period.
                    In 2016, I got a Fernandes guitar with a sustainer. Currently, I still own the ESP, the Ernie Ball, and the Fernandes.

                <p> I started dancing after graduating from university. The style of dance that I focus in is hip hop and breaking.
                    When it comes to breaking, I can currently hold a headstand and a baby freeze.
                    My main influences are Michael Jackson, Les Twins, Lia Kim, Kinjaz and many of the Red Bull BC One All Star Members.</p>

            <div class="heading">Philosphy</div>
            <p> My general approach to problems and skill acquisition can be split into 3 parts: Consumption, Incremental Progress, and Application.
                In regards to consumption, this is simply the aggregation of as much information as possible.
                This implies reading as much as possible, watching as many films as possible, playing as many games as possible and experiencing as much as possible.
                This is why I maintain a media consumption list.
                The more information you collect, the more experiences and knowledge you can draw from.
                Naturally, since there is much that needs to be consumed, it is important to prioritize what should be consumed in what order so as to maximize the usefulness of the information that is collected.
            <p> Incremental progress is the application of my experience as a computer scientist to everything.
                It consists of breaking down problems to manageable tasks and then optimizing the process so that the goal can be completed as quickly as possible.
                This allows for all problems to be framed in the context of an algorithm.
                There is also a psychological benefit that is brought by this methodology.
                Since the algorithm effectively guides one's actions, shortcomings like temporary fear or pain can be mitigated effectively by providing a deadline for goals or a maximum cycle time for an iteration.
                This is how I've gradually taught myself to sleep less and maximize my time during the day.</p>
            <p> The final step is application.
                This is where newly developed skills are solidified and then applied to other larger goals.
                This is very much like unit testing or validation of code.
                If the skills that one acquires are not of a high enough proficiency or quality, the usefulness of the skill becomes highly diminished.</p>
            <p> One final thing to note: Once a skill has been acquired, it must be maintained.
                That said, if a skill is not maintained, reacquiring the skill is easier by an order of magnitude because you have already acquired the skill in the past.
                Maintenance of a skill is typically easier than acquisition. The cost of maintenance can be marginalized by using the skill when pursuing a more difficult skill or goal.</p>
            <p> My thoughts on specialization: While specialization can lead to a high level of competence in a particular area, it can also be highly limiting and create an ideological bubble.
                Diversification of skills can lead to versatility as well as the ability to identify the intersection between different fields and areas.
                This is usually what leads to new styles of thinking and new applications of old ideas. Simply put, too much specialization can limit innovation, creativity, and increase boredom.
                E.g., a general purpose AI can potentially be far more useful than a specialized AI due to its ability to express itself in many different areas and the absence of the need to configure itself for different scenarios. Refer to Deepmind's papers and Demis Hassabis' presentations to learn more.</p>
