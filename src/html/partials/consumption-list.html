                    <p> Snipes Battle of the Year has been getting greater and greater attention over the years. This year, the heavy hitters were Jinjo Crew, Foundnation, and the Vagabonds crew. Because Jinjo had Wing and Hong10, they pretty much demolished the competition all the way to the finals.

The book's chapters are split into three parts. The first part describes a combat situation experienced by one of the book's authors that demonstrates a concept.
                        The concept is then explained in clear terms. Finally, the concept's application to the business world is clearly shown. The teachings in this work provide simple advice with clarity.</p>

                    <p> A work of art that I believe should deserve more attention. There are not many works that cover topics such as heaven and hell as well as life and death. The emphasis on the void and reincarnation diverges from the traditional themes of good and evil that can be found in monotheistic religion.
                        As a result, a more nuanced interpretation of the topics is provided in the show. This is a show that I believe can appeal to a critic's sensibility as well as to the mainstream. Every detail seems purposeful and well thought out.
                        In my opinion, this is the best anime I've seen so far this year.

                    <p> The first season was what got me started with my current routine of waking up at 4:30 and going to the gym. So, I have a bit of attachment to this series.
                        The second season is just as good in my opinion. Because it is a shounen anime, the concept of incremental progress is baked right into the themes driving the show.
                        This Japanese take on the superhero genre is unique and it has heart.

                    <p>I played through the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection in Japanese, Ground Zeros on PS4 and The Phantom Pain on ps3.
                        Because of that, I thought it would be strange for me to play this last. Despite this, I found MGS to be one of the best in the series and thoroughly enjoyable despite its age.
                        The care given to Sniper Wolf made her one of my most favorite characters in the series. Although I played the integral version, I think the game should play well on any console because of the simple controls.
                        This is a cinematic game that I think anyone will be able to enjoy.</p>

                        Not all of the content has been committed to long term memory, but important concepts like a partial and a gradient have stuck. One thing I underestimated was how much of a time suck this would be. Each video is about 10-15 minutes.
                        After this, I'll probably move onto linear algebra, or physics.

                        Compared to other 3d titles, the visuals were not the best. I can see why this is being remade. After finishing this, I recommend watching Advent Children.

                    <p>This was recommended to me by the instructor of a creative writing course that I took while I was in university. I put off watching this for a while, and I regret doing so. Brie Larson was great, but the star of the film was Jacob Tremblay. His performance was probably the best I've ever seen out of a child actor. The film captures the relationship between mother and son with great care. Although the story can be emotionally heavy, I recommend it for multiple viewings.

                    <p>A bit on the long side, but Daniel Day-Lewis's acting manages to keep the story from ever getting dull. It's not the best movie that Steven Spielberg directed, but it is still a great film that can be used as reference in regards to learning what makes a good leader.</p>

                        The story mode has a good difficulty progression. The music is memorable, and Master Chief is a great protagonist.

                    <p> I played the gamecube version of this on the dolphin emulator with a 3rd party xbox controller formatted like a ps4 controller.
                        It is easy to tell why this is one of the greatest games ever made.
                        In addition to bringing the Zelda franchise into the 3rd dimension, this game boasts great level design, and finely tuned controls.
                        The music is iconic, and the characters are memorable. This game has aged well.
                        It appeals to players of all ages and backgrounds, and has something to offer to anyone who picks up the controller and gives it a go.
                        The playtime is over 30 hours, so you won't need to worry about it ending too soon.</p>

                    <p> Watched in Imax. A film that is the culmination of three phases of films in the Marvel cinematic universe.
                        Although it may be lacking in story, it more than makes up for it with its scale and the ambitious plot that brings together all of the characters in the marvel universe.
                        In addition to this, it finally brings Thanos to the forefront and provides him with greater depth than he had in the comics. I saw the first Avengers film when I was in high school, so the payoff was particularly rewarding to me.</p>

                    <p> One of the most memorable events of the year. I never thought the rocket would successfully take off. The climax was the simultaneous landing of the side boosters.
                        It would have been nice to see the center core land on the droneship, but 2/3 is still great. The shot of starman floating off into space was a good touch.
                        Space x's have been continuously getting better over the years and this launch proved that they could not only nail the launch, but the telemetry as well.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. Great film. Although this was not my favorite Nolan film, it easily is one of the most well made among his works.
                        The shots of the fighter planes were the most technical and impressive scenes in the film. Hans Zimmer's usage of the Shepard's tone could have been more emphasized.
                        I actually did not realize that a Shepard's tone was used until looking it up after the fact. Because of how drawn out the auditory illusion was, in many cases, it felt as if the effect of the illusion was diminished.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. An underrated film; just as great as the first. Probably the best experience I've had watching a film in a movie theatre. The custom Imax intro was a nice touch.
                        The sound engineering was incredible and allowed for the audience to feel the sound instead of simply hearing it. This is a movie that sticks in your head days after you see it.</p>
