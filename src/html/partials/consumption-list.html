                    <p>A highly educational series about the workings of the body that is very much in the vein of works such as Fantastic Voyage and Osmosis Jones.
                        The details are highly accurate, making the series a useful tool for learning about microbiology and immunology.
                        The series covers topics such as allergic reactions, food poisoning, and other inner body events that require an immune response.
                        In terms of narrative, it is not the strongest, but within its genre, it is probably one of the best and makes what is usually a dry topic very interesting.

                    <p>I remember reading the book as a child, so seeing the movie was a joy for me.
                        The film adds to the source material with clever writing, great stop motion animation, and many of the quirks Wes Anderson is famous for.
                        The voice acting by George Clooney and Meryl Streep suited the characters very well and added traits to the characters that was not described in the book.
                        Because of the sophisticated writing, I feel that adults will enjoy this more than children.
                        Overall, it is a great film that surprisingly manages to fit in a lot of story within its short running time.

                        Headhunters is a skillfully crafted thriller that effortlessly plays with suspense.
                        The story covers an art thief who is on the run from the owner of one of the art pieces he stole: an above average cat and mouse thriller.
                        While it never touches on any heavy themes, its pace makes it so that it never bores.

                    <p>This is the first time I've viewed any of Osamu Hayashi's work. Japan has a constant focus on work, and the debt one owes society.
                        However, in many cases, this can remove meaning from one's existence within society.
                        Here, Hayashi Sensei discusses with many Neets who have performed well academically what it means to have a job, and why it is unreasonable to always expect for society to conform to your wishes.
                        He also explores the topics within the context of his own life experiences and clearly outlines the differences between what one wants to do in life and what what can do in life.
                        The conversation is nuanced and touches upon many different subjects and offers meaning to aspects of life that are usually never explored in depth in Japanese society.
                        If you understand Japanese, I recommend taking 30 min out of your day to view this video.

                    <p>Siddhartha is written in a lyrical style and reads very similarly to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.
                    One of the main themes of the novel is that wisdom cannot be taught, but that it must be gained through experience.
                    The usage of Siddhartha as a foil to Gautama's philosophy offers nuance that can provide greater insight into what Samsara and Nirvana is.
                    While it may come across as simplistic, I felt that the simple writing style allowed for better introspection.

                        Compared to many of the monster movies of today, this film was well thought out and carefully planned.

                    <p> The book is split into two parts. The first covers Viktor Frankl's time in the German concentration camps and the second covers logotherapy.
                        The usage of Viktor Frankl's experience during the Holocaust to explain the significance of meaning was very powerful.
                        I found logotherapy to be a more rational approach to psychotherapy and finding meaning to life than other approaches, but it does seem dated.
                        A more modern approach might utilize statistics and mathematics to clearly outline patterns in human behavior.
                        Overall, the way this work outlined purpose, the will to live, and the various perspectives by which to view suffering made it a useful read.

                        Using hypoxia to improve mental and bodily tolerances is something that I have never tried before, and the amount of added control it provides to the body makes it seem like a very valuable skill that is very similar to that which is exhibited by Shaolin monks.
                        Wim Hof's insistence on taking rigorous metrics and scientifically analyzing everything has expelled any doubts that his technique can allow for the human body to overcome various limits.

                    <p> This was not an easy book to read due to my ignorance about Russian culture and history.
                        That said, the plight of Raskolnikov was not only relatable, but it can be observed in one form or another in the lives of people today.
                        Because of this, the philosophical underpinnings were not lost in translation or lost to time.
                        The organization of the book may seem strange to some, because it switches its focus to its side characters frequently.
                        While this may be interpretted as a flaw in the novel, the treatment of the Marmeladovs and Svidrigailov gives us a more complete study of human behavior that may not be exhibited by Raskolnikov.
                        Dostoyevsky added an epilogue at the end. This, in my opinion, weakened the ending, and I recommend thoroughly skipping it.

                        As a result, the conversation reaches areas that may not be covered by other individuals who work in the field.
                        One interesting thing that Ben noted during the conversation is that the apocalypse scenario with AI seems to originate in western culture and does not seem to be recognized as much of a problem in East Asia.

                    <p> This is not Steven Spielberg's best film.
                        Although it may be lacking in terms of story and plot, the technical achievements and scale of the the set pieces are impressive.
                        The accuracy with which locations in China are presented is one of its strengths.
                        That said, the writing felt mediocre, and Christian Bale's acting could not save it. 
                        I personally did not enjoy this film or find it impressive at a critical level, but I think this may be depend on the person watching it.

                        Since this was directed by William Friedkin, great camera work is to be expected. I can see why this film had staying power more than 40 years after it was released.

                        It provides in concrete terms the types of workouts David Goggins undergoes as well as an intro into the type of person Jesse Itzler is.
                        The book offers a clear representation of the numbers that need to be reached and the attitude with which to approach tough problems to reach the level David Goggins operates at.
                        I intend to incrementally work my way up to some of the numbers in this book and hopefully surpass them in the future.

                        The hip hop soundtrack was much appreciated.
                        As someone who read many of the Spiderverse comics, I found this to be thoroughly enjoyable, and to have a great story.
                        Even if you aren't a fan of the source material, I feel that there is a lesson for everyone to take away from this movie.
                        Although this is missing characters like Silk, Anya, and Jessica Drew, I think their exclusion worked to the benefit of the film by preventing things from getting too complicated.
                        If the end credits is anything to go by, we'll have a sequel and I am looking forward to it.

                        I found that I learned quite a bit about colonial and post independence America that I did not learn in grade school.
                        In school, our knowledge tends to be very America specific, so global events, France's involvement and Canada are covered in very little detail if any.
                        I also found the tips and tricks that Benjamin Franklin developped in regards to work to be very useful. Overall, I learned that Franklin's achievements extend past his actions during America's Revolutionary war.
                        Not only was he a politician, but he was a scientist, a printer, and a well rounded person who influenced many things we take for granted today.

                        The electric skates in the simulation are gone and replaced with a set of wheels that are attached to a Tesla.
                        The tunnel itself was disappointing, but the highlight of the show is the many-fold gains made in tunneling and boring technology.
                        I'm hoping that the actual tunnels are a far more refined and practical.

                    <p>A somewhat sad film that brought back a few bad memories while I was watching it. That said, it is short and simple.
                        It does not dwell on topics, but it also does not shy away from the troubles faced by many of the children in the foster home.
                        The stop motion animation is clean and vibrant. I recommend it not only for children, but for adults as well. There is something here for everyone.
                        If you don't have a lot of time, this is a great short movie to watch.

                    <p>It seems like many of the works I've been consuming lately deals with life and death. Daytripper is a work that has a unique device where the main character dies at the end of each issue during different points in his life.
                        Daytripper not only discusses the important life changing moments that can result in the rebirth of one's identity, but also the fact that everyone will die. In many cases, it treads similar ground as Siddhartha Gautama, but it offers a more personal and modern touch that may make it easier to relate to.

                    <p>I think this is the first Swedish film I have ever seen. Although this film is not fast paced, it does not drag on and moves from scene to scene with purpose.
                        Themes of Death and God are tackled in this film and are handled very well. Even though it is in black and white, images have staying power and are carefully thought out.
                        In many ways, it makes me feel like it is an older version of Death Parade and may actually be one of the sources of inspiration that Death Parade drew from.

                    <p> This video from VICE begins with a demonstration of what a malicious attacker is capable of when they take advantage of vulnerabilities in a self driving car.
                        We live in a time where cybersecurity is growing in importance. Israel and it's military and private institutions are growing and attaining global dominance in these areas.
                        Usually, we think of the U.S., Russia, China, and the U.K.'s GCHQ as the giants in the security arena. Now, it must be acknowledged that Israel is a powerful force in intelligence and cyber warfare.
                        Recently, we've seen glimpses of Israel's power in Snowden's files, and Harvey Weinsteins' hiring of Black Cube. With the growth of private companies in Israel, I expect the frequency of Israeli firms in the news to only increase.

                    <p> A soft introduction into deep learning in the context of self driving cars. This is a class that is led by Lex Fridman. I found this to be highly interesting.
                        It includes talks by people in the industry and not only covers the technical aspects of the field, but also how policy and business is changing to accomodate the changes.
                        Also includes a very simple example that helped me better understand how gradient descent and backpropogation works. You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/nFTQ7kHQWtc?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        The class also includes some very cool projects to introduce students to concepts. I have completed the DeepTraffic project and if I have time in the future, I'd like to take a look at DeepTesla.

                        The contents of this book were heavy, and the descriptions of many of the war crimes that occured were difficult to stomach. Iris Chang wrote a compelling book, and it is unfortunate that she committed suicide. This book is not easy reading, but I feel that it is something that should be read so that we never forget what occurred.

                    <p>Available on Gutenberg. This is a translation of the Lao Tzu's work. The Tao or the Dao is often contradictory and this is to be expected because of the inherent nature of yin and yang in the Taiji.
                        In many cases, the teachings seem like common sense, but in some, the messages can seem cryptic or often unintuitive. For those who are unfamiliar with eastern philosophy, this can be difficult to conceptually grasp.
                        One thing that I found interesting was that I could see some of concepts that would later show up in Confucianism. Concepts such as humility which are very common in east Asian cultures can be found here.

                    <p>12 rules for making more sense of the world. This was intended to be a more accessible version of Maps of Meaning, but I found that this read less like a helpful guide and more like a series of essays. References to the Bible were thorough and used to explain points, but I found them to detract from the lessons being covered.
                        The book is well written, but overly long. My impression of the book is mixed. I recommend listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures instead.

                    <p> A work of art that I believe should deserve more attention. There are not many works that cover topics such as heaven and hell as well as life and death. The emphasis on the void and reincarnation diverges from the traditional themes of good and evil that can be found in monotheistic religion.
                        As a result, a more nuanced interpretation of the topics is provided in the show. This is a show that I believe can appeal to a critic's sensibility as well as to the mainstream. Every detail seems purposeful and well thought out.
                        In my opinion, this is the best anime I've seen so far this year.

                    <p>Reading this was a chore. I read Walden due to references made to it in Shane Carruth's Upstream Color. I found that it was redundant and many times contradictory. That said, it was impressive how many different ways Henry David Thoreau was able to state his appreciation of nature and the outdoors.</p>

                    <p> The first season was what got me started with my current routine of waking up at 4:30 and going to the gym. So, I have a bit of attachment to this series.
                        The second season is just as good in my opinion. Because it is a shounen anime, the concept of incremental progress is baked right into the themes driving the show.
                        This Japanese take on the superhero genre is unique and it has heart.

                        Because of that, I thought it would be strange for me to play this last. Despite this, I found MGS to be one of the best in the series and thoroughly enjoyable despite its age.
                        The care given to Sniper Wolf made her one of my most favorite characters in the series. Although I played the integral version, I think the game should play well on any console because of the simple controls.
                        This is a cinematic game that I think anyone will be able to enjoy.</p>

                        Not all of the content has been committed to long term memory, but important concepts like a partial and a gradient have stuck. One thing I underestimated was how much of a time suck this would be. Each video is about 10-15 minutes.
                        After this, I'll probably move onto linear algebra, or physics.

                        This will allow for the immersive nature of VR and AR to increase tremendously. Now, all we need are sophisticated haptic feedback systems or neural links to allow for better interaction with the virtual environments.

                    <p>This was recommended to me by the instructor of a creative writing course that I took while I was in university. I put off watching this for a while, and I regret doing so. Brie Larson was great, but the star of the film was Jacob Tremblay. His performance was probably the best I've ever seen out of a child actor. The film captures the relationship between mother and son with great care. Although the story can be emotionally heavy, I recommend it for multiple viewings.

                        It is easy to tell why this is one of the greatest games ever made.
                        In addition to bringing the Zelda franchise into the 3rd dimension, this game boasts great level design, and finely tuned controls.
                        The music is iconic, and the characters are memorable. This game has aged well.
                        It appeals to players of all ages and backgrounds, and has something to offer to anyone who picks up the controller and gives it a go.
                        The playtime is over 30 hours, so you won't need to worry about it ending too soon.</p>

                        Although it may be lacking in story, it more than makes up for it with its scale and the ambitious plot that brings together all of the characters in the marvel universe.
                        In addition to this, it finally brings Thanos to the forefront and provides him with greater depth than he had in the comics. I saw the first Avengers film when I was in high school, so the payoff was particularly rewarding to me.</p>

                    <p> The most refined show in the series in my opinion. The Eurobeat and the adrenaline pumping action does not let up. In addition to this, technical aspects of the mechanics of car racing are also covered in depth.

                    <p> One of the most memorable events of the year. I never thought the rocket would successfully take off. The climax was the simultaneous landing of the side boosters.
                        It would have been nice to see the center core land on the droneship, but 2/3 is still great. The shot of starman floating off into space was a good touch.
                        Space x's have been continuously getting better over the years and this launch proved that they could not only nail the launch, but the telemetry as well.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. Great film. Although this was not my favorite Nolan film, it easily is one of the most well made among his works.
                        The shots of the fighter planes were the most technical and impressive scenes in the film. Hans Zimmer's usage of the Shepard's tone could have been more emphasized.
                        I actually did not realize that a Shepard's tone was used until looking it up after the fact. Because of how drawn out the auditory illusion was, in many cases, it felt as if the effect of the illusion was diminished.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. An underrated film; just as great as the first. Probably the best experience I've had watching a film in a movie theatre. The custom Imax intro was a nice touch.
                        The sound engineering was incredible and allowed for the audience to feel the sound instead of simply hearing it. This is a movie that sticks in your head days after you see it.</p>
