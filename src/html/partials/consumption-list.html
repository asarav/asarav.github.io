                    <p>I don't think I have ever seen a movie like this.
                        This movie follows the story of Frank Abagnale and his adventures posing as different people while forging millions of dollars worth of checks.
                        Bank fraud is something that I never would have thought was interesting, but somehow, Spielberg managed to spin this into a thrilling character study.

                    <p>Back when this came out and helped to increase the popularity of multiplayer first-person shooters, I was unsure of what the big deal was.
                    Now that I have completed it, I found that the realism and the ability to mimic the chaos of war made it an addicting and immersive experience.
                    I can understand why it is praised by Iraq war veterans.
                    Even though this game is more than 10 years old, it still feels ambitious and manages to hit most of the right notes.

                    <p>This was an interesting read due to many companies adopting the practices that Google has-- my company included.
                    In many companies, the creative element needed to introduce interesting new products tends to be stifled, and in most they are not fostered.
                    While it is unclear whether Google's approach is the best, what is clear is that the company takes risks and is more fluid than most companies of its size.
                    Due to this, it manages to act as an example that helps to disprove many commonly held beliefs about how a company needs to be run to achieve success.

                    While I don't approve of the cliffhanger, it makes for a great way to sell the third game. I hope that I can one day finish the fight.

                    <p>I am starting to view movies not just based on critical acclaim, but also keeping cultural impact in mind.
                        Mean girls is a movie that has had great impact on modern American culture.
                        Going into this, I was expecting it to be more family friendly, but the contents are suprisingly mature given the high school setting.
                        In many ways, this movie is very similar to Easy A, but it focuses more on highschool cliques than on just popularity.
                        I think Easy A is the better movie, but both are close in quality.
                        The only major problem with Mean Girls I can think of is that it feels somewhat dated with cliques and types that have gone extinct in the 2000's.

                        Advice can be vague and sometimes even counterproductive. An example of this is Robert Kiyosaki's praising of multi-level marketing.
                        In many ways, it reads very similarly to The Art of the Deal, and does not provide enough concrete action items to work from.
                        I agree that financial education should be more important. I agree that you shouldn't work for your money and that your money should work for you.
                        However, the contents of this book felt more like a sales pitch for a class than something that people can use.

                    <p>I think the last time I found myself with a deep sense of saudade with a video game was after finishing the Mass Effect series about three years ago.
                    That was exactly how I felt when I saw the credits roll the end of FFVI.
                    From beginning to end, the game had something to offer in the form of a great story, and memorable characters.
                    Because of this, I was sad to see it end. The game had great pacing, kept the grinding to a minimum, and was filled with worlds of exploration.
                    It was ambitious, not only in its story, but in its refusal to center itself on a main character.
                    Each character was given care and attention which made the payoff at the end all the more worth the hours poured in by the player.
                    The creators knew exactly what they were doing when they named you the player as one of the characters in this SNES epic.

                    <p>This took about 4-5 months to complete and after finishing it, there are areas that I find to be shaky.
                        This isn't all that surprising considering that the math involved is difficult to conceptually understand.
                        That said, I find it fascinating that the primary building blocks of linear algebra are the skills that we build in Algebra 1.
                        By completing this, I improved my understanding of matrices, vectors, and alternate coordinate bases.
                        I also gained a better understanding of what my weak areas are.
                        I think the next step to take, in my case, is to improve my ability to complete and understand proofs.

                        Given the rate of technological improvement and automation, the economy and government policy is not evolving quickly enough to compensate.
                        Seeing how this is already a problem, it is interesting to see someone try to attack the problem.
                        While I am not sure how far he will go, I'm looking forward to seeing Andrew Yang in the Democratic presidential primary debates.

                        Another thing to note is that it is not always advantageous to expend energy to appear favorable to everyone.
                        It is just as important to choose who you want to be friends with and who you want to influence.

                    <p>This film did not have the greatest start, but picked up in quality as we started getting into the meat of the story.
                    Dallas Buyers Club takes place in Texas during the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and follows the story of Ron Woodroof who worked to get medication to help AIDS patients when treatments were still in development in the U.S..
                    While it may not be historically accurate, it manages to capture the tragic nature of living with AIDS with the great acting.
                    Jared Leto's and Matthew McConaughey's performances were what carried this movie.

                    <p>Violet Evergarden is a series focused on the intentions infused into letters.
                        The creators handle this subject matter with an appropriate amount of sensitivity through the fluidity and detail in the animation.
                        Episodes cover the topic in a simple manner by focusing on the writer, the recipients, the process of writing, delivery, and how the letters are affected by the times in which they are written.
                        In addition to this, the usage of letters as a motif that is used as an engine for character development is nothing short of masterful.
                        In this day and age where physical letters are becoming more rare, this show manages to remind us of how humans can connect with one another.

                    <p>This book introduces readers to the world of competitive memorization and some of the techniques one can use to remember things better.
                        It covers in decent depth what memory is and what role it plays in our lives as well as the history of mnemonic technique.
                        In addition to this, it also covers Joshua Foer's journey into the world of competitive memorization.
                        While the book may read like a long article in a newspaper or magazine, it has useful information.
                        Unfortunately, it is not an instructional guide to memorization and should not be treated as such.
                        If you want to improve your mnemonic techniques, I recommend reading this book to introduce yourself to the world of memorization and then researching and practicing techniques on your own.
                        Create a memory palace, and get into the habit of chunking. This book is like the packaging for a product, but not the product itself.

                    <p>Aliens feels like what you would get if you crossed the original Alien with Die Hard and then scaled everything up.
                    Although Aliens is more of an action film than sci-fi horror, James Cameron manages to keep much of what made the previous film great by only turning up the action in the second half of the film.
                    For the first half, we don't see a single alien, and this allows for the maintaining of suspense as well as foreshadowing.
                    While I prefer the original Alien because I prefer Ridley Scott's sensibilities, Aliens not only manages to match Alien in certain areas, but also manages to improve over Alien through its own unique qualities.

                        The special effects were impressive, and it is easy to see why this film influenced many horror directors as well as many Japanese directors such as Hideo Kojima and Takashi Miike.

                    <p>This was a book that went by very quickly. It read very similarly to Glenn Greenwald's No Place to Hide in terms of the general pacing and momentum the subject matter brings.
                        After reading The Lean Startup, I found myself questioning how in the world Theranos could survive for as long as it did.
                        I suppose that proves how important the pitch and connections are. That said, it seemed like they did everything wrong except for PR and marketing.
                        The executives did not listen to the engineers that worked on the testing machines, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani lied to investors and customers, the culture was toxic, and the concept of an mvp was completely foreign.

                    <p>Eric Ries is one of the founders of IMVU, and offers his approach to startups and entrepreneurship.
                        While many of his ideas are sound, if you have worked in development, you may not gain as much as others by reading this book.
                        That said, his views on using the proper metrics, innovation, and the emphasis on the minimum viable product are lessons that are very useful in both new companies and established companies.
                        Depending on your prior knowledge of agile, mvp's, innovation teams, process optimization and improvement, and startups in general, you may gain more from Peter Thiel's book than from Eric Ries'.

                    <p>The series continues with quality that is consistent with previous seasons and arguably hits notes that have not been hit before in previous seasons.
                        The focus this time around is not on what lies outside of the walls, but rather what lies within.
                        The third season plays more like a political thriller and as a result is able to provide exposition about the kingdom with nuance instead of through more heavy handed methods.
                        A pattern a keen viewer might notice is that the director is gradually cycling through the six types of conflict in literature. In previous seasons, man vs. nature and man vs. man was covered thoroughly.
                        This season focuses on man vs. society and man vs. self. If the previews of season 3 part 2 are anything to go by, we will soon seen man vs. technology and perhaps man vs. the supernatural make an appearance.
                        I am looking forward to the next part and am curious to see how the work is concluded.

                    <p>For anyone who has seen episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, you will be familiar with his playfulness with the plot to create suspense.
                        I enjoyed Psycho more than I enjoyed Vertigo, and I wonder if it is the better film. Everyone played their roles perfectly, and Anthony Perkins was the main attraction.
                        The way this movie is structured is not only smart, but contrarian and subversive. There are not many films that kill off the main character half way through the film.
                        I imagine audiences during the time were caught off guard, expecting what is perhaps a crime drama, only to find that it was something closer to a psychological thriller.
                        It is comes to no surprise that this influenced many directors in the succeeding generation.

                    <p>I remember the usage of proxy wars by PMC's within Metal Gear Solid 4 as a strong plot device, and wondered why the U.S. military was not as privatized when contractors were used to deliver products and services to be used by the military.
                    Not surprisingly, there were more contractors in Afghanistan starting in 2007 than there were U.S. forces. Yet, for some reason, this information is covered in detail in the news or by the U.S. government.
                    This video on the evolution of PMC's shows how they have played a larger and larger role in conflicts on the global scale. I not would be surprised if PMC's disrupt government militaries in the future by not only performing better, but working more efficiently without a large bureaucracy.
                    While the concept may be troubling, I think it's only a matter of time for PMC's to do to the military what Space X has begun to do to NASA and ROSCOSMOS.

                    <p>This is a hard, time consuming read that is dense with ideas. The book introduces us to System 1 and System 2 which are the two systems that govern how how thinking and brain power is allocated.
                        These two systems are used as the basis of explaining many of the insufficiencies of the human mind. Topics such as the limitations of intuition, inability to maximize utility, and the superseding of rational thought by emotional reactions are covered.
                        While the book may read like a textbook, it is very thought provoking. The implications extend to all aspects of our society and may explain why certain policies are favored in government, why one interview candidate was chosen over the other, even if the other choice is objectively better than what was ultimately chosen.

                        The show uses a combination of different animation techniques such as rotoscoping and live action to better show many of the abstract thoughts the creators wished to convey and to better educate about the disorders including the outlining of any artistic licenses that have been taken.
                        The experimental approach to the topics covered is growing more rare in the animation industry in Japan, but the care given to the work reinforces the case for greater risks to be taken in animation.
                        Because many of the cases are specific to Japan, the show also manages to touch upon the collective unconcious of the country. I think Carl Jung would be proud.

                        I felt like I had deja vu watching this, because, like the Lee Sedol vs Alphago games, I did not have a full understanding of the rules of the games.
                        That said, it was exciting to watch just like the alphago games. This time, Deepmind set their sights on Starcraft II.
                        What I found interesting about the AI was that it did not have as high of an APM as the pro players. It seemed to deliberately choose its actions.
                        This most likely indicates that the pro players have many redundant actions.
                        My guess is that the AI noticed patterns within the game that humans have overlooked.
                        I recommend reading Deepmind's blog post about the event <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <p>It's a sin to kill a mockingbird. I have never read this novel before, and after reading it, I can understand why it is part of many high school curriculums.
                        While, many focus on its coverage of the treatment of African Americans during the depression era, the novel is a coming of age story at its heart that shows how nonsensical the world can be through a child's eyes.
                        I found many of the characters to be convincing and well thought out. This was particularly the case with Atticus Finch who is shown to be a rare example of a principled man in a town with racist tendencies.
                        I intend to watch the film in the near future.

                    <p>A highly educational series about the workings of the body that is very much in the vein of works such as Fantastic Voyage and Osmosis Jones.
                        The details are highly accurate, making the series a useful tool for learning about microbiology and immunology.
                        The series covers topics such as allergic reactions, food poisoning, and other inner body events that require an immune response.
                        In terms of narrative, it is not the strongest, but within its genre, it is probably one of the best and makes what is usually a dry topic very interesting.
                        I recommend supplementing your viewing with Dr. Hope's Sick Notes commentary of the individual episodes.

                        The film adds to the source material with clever writing, great stop motion animation, and many of the quirks Wes Anderson is famous for.
                        The voice acting by George Clooney and Meryl Streep suited the characters very well and added traits to the characters that was not described in the book.
                        Because of the sophisticated writing, I feel that adults will enjoy this more than children.
                        Overall, it is a great film that surprisingly manages to fit in a lot of story within its short running time.

                        Headhunters is a skillfully crafted thriller that effortlessly plays with suspense.
                        The story covers an art thief who is on the run from the owner of one of the art pieces he stole: an above average cat and mouse thriller.
                        While it never touches on any heavy themes, its pace makes it so that it never bores.

                    <p>This is the first time I've viewed any of Osamu Hayashi's work. Japan has a constant focus on work, and the debt one owes society.
                        However, in many cases, this can remove meaning from one's existence within society.
                        Here, Hayashi Sensei discusses with many Neets who have performed well academically what it means to have a job, and why it is unreasonable to always expect for society to conform to your wishes.
                        He also explores the topics within the context of his own life experiences and clearly outlines the differences between what one wants to do in life and what what can do in life.
                        The conversation is nuanced and touches upon many different subjects and offers meaning to aspects of life that are usually never explored in depth in Japanese society.
                        If you understand Japanese, I recommend taking 30 min out of your day to view this video.

                    <p>Siddhartha is written in a lyrical style and reads very similarly to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.
                    One of the main themes of the novel is that wisdom cannot be taught, but that it must be gained through experience.
                    The usage of Siddhartha as a foil to Gautama's philosophy offers nuance that can provide greater insight into what Samsara and Nirvana is.
                    While it may come across as simplistic, I felt that the simple writing style allowed for better introspection.

                    <p> The book is split into two parts. The first covers Viktor Frankl's time in the German concentration camps and the second covers logotherapy.
                        The usage of Viktor Frankl's experience during the Holocaust to explain the significance of meaning was very powerful.
                        I found logotherapy to be a more rational approach to psychotherapy and finding meaning to life than other approaches, but it does seem dated.
                        A more modern approach might utilize statistics and mathematics to clearly outline patterns in human behavior.
                        Overall, the way this work outlined purpose, the will to live, and the various perspectives by which to view suffering made it a useful read.

                        Using hypoxia to improve mental and bodily tolerances is something that I have never tried before, and the amount of added control it provides to the body makes it seem like a very valuable skill that is very similar to that which is exhibited by Shaolin monks.
                        Wim Hof's insistence on taking rigorous metrics and scientifically analyzing everything has expelled any doubts that his technique can allow for the human body to overcome various limits.

                    <p> This was not an easy book to read due to my ignorance about Russian culture and history.
                        That said, the plight of Raskolnikov was not only relatable, but it can be observed in one form or another in the lives of people today.
                        Because of this, the philosophical underpinnings were not lost in translation or lost to time.
                        The organization of the book may seem strange to some, because it switches its focus to its side characters frequently.
                        While this may be interpretted as a flaw in the novel, the treatment of the Marmeladovs and Svidrigailov gives us a more complete study of human behavior that may not be exhibited by Raskolnikov.
                        Dostoyevsky added an epilogue at the end. This, in my opinion, weakened the ending, and I recommend thoroughly skipping it.

                        As a result, the conversation reaches areas that may not be covered by other individuals who work in the field.
                        One interesting thing that Ben noted during the conversation is that the apocalypse scenario with AI seems to originate in western culture and does not seem to be recognized as much of a problem in East Asia.

                    <p> This is not Steven Spielberg's best film.
                        Although it may be lacking in terms of story and plot, the technical achievements and scale of the the set pieces are impressive.
                        The accuracy with which locations in China are presented is one of its strengths.
                        That said, the writing felt mediocre, and Christian Bale's acting could not save it. 
                        I personally did not enjoy this film or find it impressive at a critical level, but I think this may be depend on the person watching it.

                        It provides in concrete terms the types of workouts David Goggins undergoes as well as an intro into the type of person Jesse Itzler is.
                        The book offers a clear representation of the numbers that need to be reached and the attitude with which to approach tough problems to reach the level David Goggins operates at.
                        I intend to incrementally work my way up to some of the numbers in this book and hopefully surpass them in the future.

                        The hip hop soundtrack was much appreciated.
                        As someone who read many of the Spiderverse comics, I found this to be thoroughly enjoyable, and to have a great story.
                        Even if you aren't a fan of the source material, I feel that there is a lesson for everyone to take away from this movie.
                        Although this is missing characters like Silk, Anya, and Jessica Drew, I think their exclusion worked to the benefit of the film by preventing things from getting too complicated.
                        If the end credits is anything to go by, we'll have a sequel and I am looking forward to it.

                        I found that I learned quite a bit about colonial and post independence America that I did not learn in grade school.
                        In school, our knowledge tends to be very America specific, so global events, France's involvement and Canada are covered in very little detail if any.
                        I also found the tips and tricks that Benjamin Franklin developped in regards to work to be very useful. Overall, I learned that Franklin's achievements extend past his actions during America's Revolutionary war.
                        Not only was he a politician, but he was a scientist, a printer, and a well rounded person who influenced many things we take for granted today.

                        The electric skates in the simulation are gone and replaced with a set of wheels that are attached to a Tesla.
                        The tunnel itself was disappointing, but the highlight of the show is the many-fold gains made in tunneling and boring technology.
                        I'm hoping that the actual tunnels are a far more refined and practical.

                    <p>A somewhat sad film that brought back a few bad memories while I was watching it. That said, it is short and simple.
                        It does not dwell on topics, but it also does not shy away from the troubles faced by many of the children in the foster home.
                        The stop motion animation is clean and vibrant. I recommend it not only for children, but for adults as well. There is something here for everyone.
                        If you don't have a lot of time, this is a great short movie to watch.

                    <p>It seems like many of the works I've been consuming lately deals with life and death. Daytripper is a work that has a unique device where the main character dies at the end of each issue during different points in his life.
                        Daytripper not only discusses the important life changing moments that can result in the rebirth of one's identity, but also the fact that everyone will die. In many cases, it treads similar ground as Siddhartha Gautama, but it offers a more personal and modern touch that may make it easier to relate to.

                    <p>I think this is the first Swedish film I have ever seen. Although this film is not fast paced, it does not drag on and moves from scene to scene with purpose.
                        Themes of Death and God are tackled in this film and are handled very well. Even though it is in black and white, images have staying power and are carefully thought out.
                        In many ways, it makes me feel like it is an older version of Death Parade and may actually be one of the sources of inspiration that Death Parade drew from.

                    <p> This video from VICE begins with a demonstration of what a malicious attacker is capable of when they take advantage of vulnerabilities in a self driving car.
                        We live in a time where cybersecurity is growing in importance. Israel and it's military and private institutions are growing and attaining global dominance in these areas.
                        Usually, we think of the U.S., Russia, China, and the U.K.'s GCHQ as the giants in the security arena. Now, it must be acknowledged that Israel is a powerful force in intelligence and cyber warfare.
                        Recently, we've seen glimpses of Israel's power in Snowden's files, and Harvey Weinsteins' hiring of Black Cube. With the growth of private companies in Israel, I expect the frequency of Israeli firms in the news to only increase.

                    <p> A soft introduction into deep learning in the context of self driving cars. This is a class that is led by Lex Fridman. I found this to be highly interesting.
                        It includes talks by people in the industry and not only covers the technical aspects of the field, but also how policy and business is changing to accomodate the changes.
                        Also includes a very simple example that helped me better understand how gradient descent and backpropogation works. You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/nFTQ7kHQWtc?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        The class also includes some very cool projects to introduce students to concepts. I have completed the DeepTraffic project and if I have time in the future, I'd like to take a look at DeepTesla.

                        The contents of this book were heavy, and the descriptions of many of the war crimes that occured were difficult to stomach. Iris Chang wrote a compelling book, and it is unfortunate that she committed suicide. This book is not easy reading, but I feel that it is something that should be read so that we never forget what occurred.

                    <p>Available on Gutenberg. This is a translation of the Lao Tzu's work. The Tao or the Dao is often contradictory and this is to be expected because of the inherent nature of yin and yang in the Taiji.
                        In many cases, the teachings seem like common sense, but in some, the messages can seem cryptic or often unintuitive. For those who are unfamiliar with eastern philosophy, this can be difficult to conceptually grasp.
                        One thing that I found interesting was that I could see some of concepts that would later show up in Confucianism. Concepts such as humility which are very common in east Asian cultures can be found here.

                    <p>12 rules for making more sense of the world. This was intended to be a more accessible version of Maps of Meaning, but I found that this read less like a helpful guide and more like a series of essays. References to the Bible were thorough and used to explain points, but I found them to detract from the lessons being covered.
                        The book is well written, but overly long. My impression of the book is mixed. I recommend listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures instead.

                    <p> A work of art that I believe should deserve more attention. There are not many works that cover topics such as heaven and hell as well as life and death. The emphasis on the void and reincarnation diverges from the traditional themes of good and evil that can be found in monotheistic religion.
                        As a result, a more nuanced interpretation of the topics is provided in the show. This is a show that I believe can appeal to a critic's sensibility as well as to the mainstream. Every detail seems purposeful and well thought out.
                        In my opinion, this is the best anime I've seen so far this year.

                    <p>Reading this was a chore. I read Walden due to references made to it in Shane Carruth's Upstream Color. I found that it was redundant and many times contradictory. That said, it was impressive how many different ways Henry David Thoreau was able to state his appreciation of nature and the outdoors.</p>

                    <p> The first season was what got me started with my current routine of waking up at 4:30 and going to the gym. So, I have a bit of attachment to this series.
                        The second season is just as good in my opinion. Because it is a shounen anime, the concept of incremental progress is baked right into the themes driving the show.
                        This Japanese take on the superhero genre is unique and it has heart.

                    <p>I played through the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection in Japanese, Ground Zeros on PS4 and The Phantom Pain on ps3.
                        Because of that, I thought it would be strange for me to play this last. Despite this, I found MGS to be one of the best in the series and thoroughly enjoyable despite its age.
                        The care given to Sniper Wolf made her one of my most favorite characters in the series. Although I played the integral version, I think the game should play well on any console because of the simple controls.
                        This is a cinematic game that I think anyone will be able to enjoy.</p>

                        After this, I'll probably move onto linear algebra, or physics.

                        This will allow for the immersive nature of VR and AR to increase tremendously. Now, all we need are sophisticated haptic feedback systems or neural links to allow for better interaction with the virtual environments.

                    <p>This was recommended to me by the instructor of a creative writing course that I took while I was in university. I put off watching this for a while, and I regret doing so. Brie Larson was great, but the star of the film was Jacob Tremblay. His performance was probably the best I've ever seen out of a child actor. The film captures the relationship between mother and son with great care. Although the story can be emotionally heavy, I recommend it for multiple viewings.

                        It is easy to tell why this is one of the greatest games ever made.
                        In addition to bringing the Zelda franchise into the 3rd dimension, this game boasts great level design, and finely tuned controls.
                        The music is iconic, and the characters are memorable. This game has aged well.
                        It appeals to players of all ages and backgrounds, and has something to offer to anyone who picks up the controller and gives it a go.
                        The playtime is over 30 hours, so you won't need to worry about it ending too soon.</p>

                        Although it may be lacking in story, it more than makes up for it with its scale and the ambitious plot that brings together all of the characters in the marvel universe.
                        In addition to this, it finally brings Thanos to the forefront and provides him with greater depth than he had in the comics. I saw the first Avengers film when I was in high school, so the payoff was particularly rewarding to me.</p>

                    <p> The most refined show in the series in my opinion. The Eurobeat and the adrenaline pumping action does not let up. In addition to this, technical aspects of the mechanics of car racing are also covered in depth.

                    <p> One of the most memorable events of the year. I never thought the rocket would successfully take off. The climax was the simultaneous landing of the side boosters.
                        It would have been nice to see the center core land on the droneship, but 2/3 is still great. The shot of starman floating off into space was a good touch.
                        Space x's have been continuously getting better over the years and this launch proved that they could not only nail the launch, but the telemetry as well.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. Great film. Although this was not my favorite Nolan film, it easily is one of the most well made among his works.
                        The shots of the fighter planes were the most technical and impressive scenes in the film. Hans Zimmer's usage of the Shepard's tone could have been more emphasized.
                        I actually did not realize that a Shepard's tone was used until looking it up after the fact. Because of how drawn out the auditory illusion was, in many cases, it felt as if the effect of the illusion was diminished.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. An underrated film; just as great as the first. Probably the best experience I've had watching a film in a movie theatre. The custom Imax intro was a nice touch.
                        The sound engineering was incredible and allowed for the audience to feel the sound instead of simply hearing it. This is a movie that sticks in your head days after you see it.</p>
