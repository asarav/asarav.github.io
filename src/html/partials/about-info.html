            <p>My freshman year of undergrad, I was involved in the Lloyd Hall Scholars program so that I could focus on some of my more artistic interests.
            I initially entered the Ross School of Business with the intention of completing a BBA with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Japanese language before switching to focus mainly on Computer Science and Japanese</p>
            <p>During the entirety of my time as a undergraduate student, I was a member of Circle K.</p>

            <p> In 2013, I completed my first internship in Chennai India at Perficient.
            This was the first time I was exposed to global business and software development in the professional space.
            I primarily worked on web based solutions using JSP with J2EE java.</p>

                The company I worked at is known as 日本ソフト開発.
                I spoke entirely in Japanese during this time and built cloud based products intended for Japanese consumers.</p>

                I spoke mainly in Japanese and worked on developing tools for cloud based video editing and transcoders.
                My previous knowledge of film turned out to be very useful during this period.

            <p> Film has always been my first love ever since high school.
                Although my interest has slightly waned after the death of Roger Ebert, I still try to stay up to date on the more popular and critically acclaimed films that are released every year.
                My favorite directors are Kubrick, Nolan, Sergio Leone, and Mamoru Oshii. Recently, Denis Villeneuve has been getting close to making his way into that list.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <p> I started learning Japanese in high school and continued in college.
                After my internship in Hikone, I received N2 Certification in the JLPT.
                I am capable of reading manga and light novels.
                Because of the nature of my previous work experiences, I actually find technical discussions easier to navigate than casual conversations.
                I am also capable of phoenetically reading Hangul due to a semester of Korean language that I took as an undergraduate.

    <div id="guitar">
        <div class="row">
            <p> I started taking guitar seriously around the time when I started attending university as an undergraduate.
                Initially, I just wanted to be able to play  songs competently, but as I progressed and learned more advanced techniques, my approach became more technical.
                I play a neoclassical style and focus mainly on complex tapping licks. That said, I can also sweep and shred.
                For some reason, I use economy picking on the way down, and alternate picking on the way up. I'm not entirely sure when I started doing this.
                My main influences are Buckethead, Shawn Lane, Paul Gilbert, and Yngwie Malmsteen.
                My first guitar was a squire bullet. When I was working at Perficient I also played a squire bullet for the internship period. I then upgraded to an ESP LTD model with a floyd rose.
                When I was working in Hikone, I played an Aria Magna. After that, I got a used Ernie Ball John Petrucci signature series. When I was working for Sony, I played an Ibanez Gio for the internship period.
                In 2016, I got a Fernandes guitar with a sustainer. Currently, I still own the ESP, the Ernie Ball, and the Fernandes.

    <div id="dance">
        <div class="row">
            <p> I started dancing after graduating from university. The style of dance that I focus in is hip hop and breaking.
                When it comes to breaking, I can current hold a headstand and a baby freeze.
                My main influences are Michael Jackson, Les Twins, Lia Kim, Kinjaz and many of the Red Bull BC One All Star Members.

<section id="philosophy">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p> My general approach to problems can be split into 3 parts: Consumption, Incremental Progress, and Application.
                In regards to consumption, this is simply the aggregation of as much information as possible.
                This implies reading as much as possible, watching as many films as possible, playing as many games as possible and experiencing as much as possible.
                The more information you collect, the more experiences and knowledge you can draw from.
                Naturally, since there is much that needs to be consumed, it is important to prioritize what should be consumed in what order so as to maximize the usefulness of the information that is collected.
            <p> Incremental progress is the application of my experience as a computer scientist to everything.</p>
                It consists of breaking down problems to manageable tasks and then optimizing the process so that the goal can be completed as quickly as possible.
                This allows for all problems to be framed in the context of an algorithm.
                There is also a psychological benefit that is brought by this methodology.
                Since the algorithm effectively guides one's actions, shortcomings like temporary fear or pain can be mitigated effectively by providing a deadline for goals or a maximum cycle time for an iteration.
                This is how I've gradually taught myself to sleep less and maximize my time during the day.</p>
            <p> The final step is application.
                This is where newly developped skills are solidified and then applied to other larger goals.
                This is very much like unit testing or validation of code.
                If the skills that one acquires are not of a high enough proficiency or quality, the usefulness of the skill becomes highly diminished.</p>
            <p> One final thing to note: Once a skill has been acquired, it must be maintained.
                That said, if a skill is not maintained, reacquiring the skill is easier by an order of magnitude because you have already acquired the skill in the past.
                Maintenance of a skill is typically easier than acquisition. The cost of maintenance can be marginalized by using the skill when pursuing a more difficult skill or goal</p>
