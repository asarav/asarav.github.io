            <p>Our civilization, despite all its achievements, is hopelessly unaware of the dangers that lurk beyond our senses and beyond our third dimension.
                It is only when it is too late that we realize how little we know and how powerless we are.
                In the near future, the human race is transformed into one being with the memories of billions and forced to wander the universe endlessly till the end where nothing is left.
                As centuries turn into trillions of years, the sanity of Humanity is brought to the brink as it questions what it sees out there in the vacuum of space and looks back upon the past it barely remembers in a desperate attempt to secure a mental foothold that somewhat resembles what it once experienced when it was billions of people walking the earth.
            </p>
            <p>Dreaming of a Hopeful Death is an introspective philosophical and science fiction journey through the universe which tries to answer the question of what would happen if the entirety of the human race had its free will taken away and was forced on an unending trip through space until the heat death of the universe.

            <p>This is my debut novel under the penname A. S. Mori and is hopefully the first of many.
            It will be available under ebook format, paperback, and hardcover.
            I also intend to adapt it as a visual novel and make it available for free on Steam in the coming months.
