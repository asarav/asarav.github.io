                    <p> One of the most memorable events of the year. I never thought the rocket would successfully take off. The climax was the simultaneous landing of the side boosters.
                        It would have been nice to see the center core land on the droneship, but 2/3 is still great. The shot of starman floating off into space was a good touch.
                        Space x's have been continuously getting better over the years and this launch proved that they could not only nail the launch, but the telemetry as well.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. Great film. Although this was not my favorite Nolan film, it easily is one of the most well made among his works.
                        The shots of the fighter planes were the most technical and impressive scenes in the film. Hans Zimmer's usage of the Shepard's tone could have been more emphasized.
                        I actually did not realize that a Shepard's tone was used until looking it up after the fact. Because of how drawn out the auditory illusion was, in many cases, it felt as if the effect of the illusion was diminished.

                    <p> Saw this in imax. An underrated film; just as great as the first. Probably the best experience I've had watching a film in a movie theatre. The custom Imax intro was a nice touch.
                        The sound engineering was incredible and allowed for the audience to feel the sound instead of simply hearing it. This is a movie that sticks in your head days after you see it.</p>
